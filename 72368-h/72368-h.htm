</div>


<p>The lectures given in this volume were originally
delivered by Swâmi Vivekânanda in
New York in the beginning of 1896, and were
received with the greatest enthusiasm. Their
purely philosophical character, however, made
it doubtful as to whether they would appeal to
the general public, and for that reason they
were not brought out in book form at once.
The great success of the London lectures on
Jnâna Yoga, which were published several
years ago and which have already gone through
two editions, now encourages the belief that
this series will meet with an equally favorable
reception. The conception of Jnâna according
to Vedânta is a bold and daring one, and
reaches the highest possible ideal, for it teaches
the absolute unity of all existence. As will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
easily understood by the students of the former
volume, Jnâna Yoga is purely monistic on the
highest spiritual plane. Speaking about this
phase of Vedânta, Prof. Max Müller writes:
“None of our philosophers, not excepting
Heraclitus, Plato, Kant, or Hegel has ventured
to erect such a spire, never frightened by storms
or lightnings. Stone follows on stone in regular
succession after once the first step has been
made, after once it has been clearly seen that
in the beginning there can have been but One,
as there will be but One in the end, whether
we call It Âtman or Brahman.” This may be
a difficult thought for many to grasp at the
outset, but it is worth careful study, and once
understood will be a never-failing light to guide
the enquiring soul to the crowning truth of all
philosophy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>This universe of ours, the universe of the
senses, the rational, the intellectual, is bounded
on both sides by the illimitable, the unknowable,
the ever unknown. Herein is the search,
herein are the inquiries, here are the facts,
from this comes the light which is known to
the world as religion. Essentially, however,
religion belongs to the supersensuous and not
to the sense plane. It is beyond all reasoning
and is not on the plane of intellect. It is a
vision, an inspiration, a plunge into the unknown
and unknowable, making the unknowable
more than known, for it can never be
“known.” This search has been in the human
mind, as I believe, from the very beginning
of humanity. There cannot have been human
reasoning and intellect in any period of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
world’s history without this struggle, this
search beyond. In our little universe, this
human mind, we see a thought arise. Whence
it arises we do not know, and when it disappears,
where it goes we know not either.
The macrocosm and the microcosm are, as it
were, in the same groove, passing through the
same stages, vibrating in the same key.</p>

<p>In these lectures I shall try to bring before
you the Hindu theory that religions do not
come from without, but from within. It is
my belief that religious thought is in man’s
very constitution, so much so that it is impossible
for him to give up religion until he can
give up his mind and body, until he can give
up thought and life. As long as a man thinks,
this struggle must go on, and so long man
must have some form of religion. Thus we
see various forms of religion in the world.
It is a bewildering study, but it is not, as many
of us think, a vain speculation. Amidst this
chaos there is harmony, throughout these discordant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
sounds there is a note of concord, and
he who is prepared to listen to it will catch
the tone.</p>

<p>The great question of all questions at the
present time is this: Taking for granted that
the known and the knowable are bounded on
both sides by the unknowable and the infinitely
unknown, why struggle for that infinite unknown?
Why shall we not be content with
the known? Why shall we not rest satisfied
with eating, drinking, and doing a little good
to society? This idea is in the air. From the
most learned professor to the prattling baby,
we are told to do good to the world, that is
all of religion, and that it is useless to trouble
ourselves about questions of the beyond. So
much is this the case that it has become a
truism. But fortunately we <i>must</i> question the
beyond. This present, this expressed, is only
one part of that unexpressed. The sense universe
is, as it were, only one portion, one bit
of that infinite spiritual universe projected into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the plane of sense consciousness. How can
this little bit of projection be explained, be
understood, without knowing that which is
beyond? It is said of Socrates that one day
while lecturing at Athens, he met a Brahmin
who had travelled into Greece, and Socrates
told the Brahmin that the greatest study for
mankind is man. The Brahmin sharply retorted:
“How can you know man until you
know God?” This God, this eternally unknowable,
or absolute, or infinite, or without name,—you
may call Him by what name you like,—is
the rational, the only explanation, the <i>raison
d’être</i> of that which is known and knowable,
this present life. Take anything before you,
the most material thing; take one of the most
material sciences, as chemistry or physics, astronomy
or biology, study it, push the study
forward and forward, and the gross forms will
begin to melt and become finer and finer, until
they come to a point where you are bound to
make a tremendous leap from these material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
things into the immaterial. The gross melts
into the fine, physics into metaphysics, in every
department of knowledge.</p>

<p>Thus man finds himself driven to a study
of the beyond. Life will be a desert, human
life will be vain if we cannot know the beyond.
It is very well to say: Be contented with the
things of the present; the cows and the dogs
are, and all animals, and that is what makes
them animals. So if man rests content with
the present and gives up all search into the
beyond, mankind will have to go back to the
animal plane again. It is religion, the inquiry
into the beyond, that makes the difference between
man and an animal. Well has it been
said that man is the only animal that naturally
looks upwards; every other animal naturally
looks prone. That looking upward and going
upward and seeking perfection are what is
called salvation, and the sooner a man begins
to go higher, the sooner he raises himself
towards this idea of truth as salvation. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
does not consist in the amount of money in
your pocket, or the dress you wear, or the
house you live in, but in the wealth of spiritual
thought in your brain. That is what makes
for human progress, that is the source of all
material and intellectual progress, the motive
power behind, the enthusiasm that pushes
mankind forward.</p>

<p>Religion does not live in bread, does not
dwell in a house. Again and again you hear
this objection advanced, “What good can religion
do? Can it take away the poverty of
the poor”? Supposing it cannot, would that
prove the untruth of religion? Suppose a baby
stands up among you when you are trying to
demonstrate an astronomical theorem, and
says: “Does it bring gingerbread?” “No, it
does not,” you answer. “Then,” says the baby,
“it is useless.” Babies judge the whole universe
from their own standpoint, that of producing
gingerbread, and so are the babies of
the world. We must not judge of higher things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
from a low standpoint. Everything must be
judged by its own standard and the infinite
must be judged by an infinite standard. Religion
permeates the whole of man’s life, not
only the present, but the past, present, and
future. It is therefore the eternal relation
between the eternal soul and the eternal God.
Is it logical to measure its value by its action
upon five minutes of human life? Certainly
not. These are all negative arguments.</p>

<p>Now comes the question, can religion really
accomplish anything? It can. It brings to
man eternal life. It has made man what he
is and will make of this human animal a god.
That is what religion can do. Take religion
from human society and what will remain?
Nothing but a forest of brutes. Sense-happiness
is not the goal of humanity; wisdom
(Jnânam) is the goal of all life. We find that
man enjoys his intellect more than an animal
enjoys its senses, and we see that man enjoys
his spiritual nature even more than his rational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
nature. So the highest wisdom must be this
spiritual knowledge. With this knowledge will
come bliss. All these things of this world are
but the shadows, the manifestations in the
third or fourth degree of the real Knowledge
and Bliss.</p>

<p>One question more: What is the goal?
Nowadays it is asserted that man is infinitely
progressing, forward and forward, and there
is no goal of perfection to attain to. Ever
approaching, never attaining, whatever that
may mean and however wonderful it may
be, it is absurd on the face of it. Is there
any motion in a straight line? A straight
line infinitely projected becomes a circle, it
returns to the starting point. You must
end where you begin, and as you began in
God, you must go back to God. What remains?
Detail work. Through eternity you
have to do the detail work.</p>

<p>Yet another question. Are we to discover
new truths of religion as we go on? Yea and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
nay. In the first place we cannot know anything
more of religion, it has all been known.
In all the religions of the world you will find
it claimed that there is a unity within us.
Being one with divinity, there cannot be any
further progress in that sense. Knowledge
means finding this unity. I see you as men
and women, and this is variety. It becomes
scientific knowledge when I group you together
and call you human beings. Take the science
of chemistry, for instance. Chemists are
seeking to resolve all known substances into
their original elements and if possible to find
the one element from which all these were
derived. The time may come when they will
find one element that is the source of all other
elements. Reaching that, they can go no farther;
the science of chemistry will have become
perfect. So it is with the science of religion.
If we can discover this perfect unity, there
cannot be any farther progress.</p>

<p>The next question is can such a unity be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
found? In India the attempt has been made
from the earliest times to reach a science of
religion and philosophy, for the Hindus do
not separate these as is customary in Western
countries. We regard religion and philosophy
as but two aspects of one thing which must
equally be grounded in reason and scientific
truth. In the lectures that are to follow I shall
try to explain to you first the system of the
<i>Sânkhya</i> philosophy, one of the most ancient
in India, or in fact in the world. Its great
exponent Kapila is the father of all Hindu
psychology and the ancient system that he
taught is still the foundation of all accepted
systems of philosophy in India to-day,—which
are known as the <i>Dârsanas</i>. They all adopt
his psychology, however widely they differ in
other respects.</p>

<p>Next I shall endeavor to show you how
Vedânta, as the logical outcome of the
<i>Sânkhya</i>, pushes its conclusions yet farther.
While its cosmology agrees with that taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
by Kapila, the Vedânta is not satisfied to end
in dualism, but continues its search for the
final unity which is alike the goal of science
and religion. To make clear the manner in
which the task is accomplished will be the
effort of the later lectures in this course.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE SÂNKHYA COSMOLOGY</p>


<p>Here are two words, the microcosm and
the macrocosm, the internal and the external.
We get truths from both of these by means of
experience; there is internal experience and
external experience. The truths gathered from
internal experience are psychology, metaphysics
and religion; from external experience
the physical sciences. Now a perfect truth
should be in harmony with experience in both
these worlds. The microcosm must bear testimony
to the macrocosm, and the macrocosm to
the microcosm; physical truth must have its
counterpart in the internal world, and the internal
world must have its verification in the
outside. Yet as a rule we find that many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
these truths are constantly conflicting. At one
period of the world’s history the “internals”
became supreme, and they began to fight the
“externals;” at the present time the “externals,”
the physicists, have become supreme,
and they have put down many claims of the
psychologists and metaphysicians. So far as
my little knowledge goes, I find that the really
essential parts of psychology are in perfect accordance
with the essential parts of modern
physical knowledge.</p>

<p>It is not given to every individual to be
great in every respect; it is not given to the
same race, or nation, to be equally strong in
the research of all the fields of knowledge.
The modern European nations are very strong
in their researches into external physical
knowledge, but the ancient Europeans were
weak in their researches into the internal part
of man. On the other hand, the Orientals
have not been very strong in their researches
in the external physical world, but have excelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
in their researches into the internal, and
therefore we find that some of the Oriental
theories are not in accordance with Occidental
physics, neither is Occidental psychology in
harmony with Oriental teachings on this subject.
The Oriental physicists have been criticised
by Occidental scientists. At the same
time each rests on truth, and, as we stated before,
real truth in any field of knowledge will
not contradict itself, the truths internal are in
harmony with the truths external.</p>

<p>We know the present theories of the Cosmos
according to the modern astronomers and
physicists, and at the same time we know how
wofully they hurt the old school of theologians,
and how every new scientific discovery that
is made is as a bomb thrown into their house,
and how they have attempted in every age to
put down all these researches. In the first
place, let us go over the psychological and
scientific ideas of the Orientals as to cosmology
and all that pertains to it, and you will find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
how wonderfully it is in accordance with all
the latest discoveries of modern science, and
when there is anything lacking you will find
that it is on the side of modern science. We
all use the word Nature, and the old Hindu
philosophers called it by two different names,
<i>Prakriti</i>, which is almost the same as the English
word “nature,” and by the more scientific
name, <i>Avyaktam</i> (“undifferentiated”), from
which everything proceeds, out of which come
atoms and molecules, matter and force, and
mind and intellect. It is startling to find that
the philosophers and metaphysicians of India
ages ago stated that mind is but matter in a
finer form, for what are our present materialists
striving to do but to show that mind is as
much a product of nature as the body? And
so is thought; and we shall find by and by
that the intellect also comes from the same
nature which is called <i>avyaktam</i>, the undifferentiated.</p>

<p>The ancient teachers define <i>avyaktam</i> as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
“equilibrium of the three forces,” one of which
is called <i>Sattva</i>, the second <i>Rajas</i> and the third
<i>Tamas</i>. <i>Tamas</i>, the lowest force, is that of
attraction, a little higher is <i>Rajas</i>, that of repulsion,
and the highest is the control of these
two, <i>Sattva</i>, so that when the two forces, attraction
and repulsion, are held in perfect control,
or balance, by the <i>Sattva</i>, there is no
creation, no movement; but as soon as this
equilibrium is lost, the balance is disturbed and
one of these forces gets stronger than the
other. Then change and motion begin and all
this evolution goes on. This state of things
is going on cyclically, periodically; that is to
say, there is a period of disturbance of the
balance, when all these forces begin to combine
and recombine, and this universe is projected;
and there is also a period when everything
has a tendency to revert to the primal state
of equilibrium, and the time comes when a
total absence of all manifestation is reached.
Again, after a period, the whole thing is disturbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
projected outward, again it slowly
comes out in the form of waves; for all motion
in this universe is in the form of waves, successive
rise and fall.</p>

<p>Some of these old philosophers taught that
the whole universe quiets down for a period;
others maintained that this quieting down applies
only to systems. That is to say, that while
our system here, this solar system, will quiet
down and go back into that undifferentiated
state, there are millions of other systems going
the other way. I should rather follow the
second opinion, that this quieting down is not
simultaneous over the whole universe, but that
in different parts different things are going on.
But the principle remains the same, that all
that we see, that Nature herself is progressing
in successive rises and falls. The one stage,
going back to the balance, to the perfect equilibrium,
is called the end of a cycle. The whole
<i>Kalpa</i>, the evolution and the involution, has
been compared by theistic writers in India to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the inbreathing and outbreathing of God; God,
as it were, breathes out the universe, and it
returns into Him again. When it quiets down,
what becomes of the universe? It still exists,
only in finer form, as it is called in Sanskrit,
in the “causal state” (<i>Kârana Sarira</i>). Causation,
time and space are still there, only they
are potential. This return to an undifferentiated
condition constitutes involution. Involution
and evolution are eternally going on, so
that when we speak of a beginning, we refer
only to the beginning of a cycle.</p>

<p>The most extraneous part of the universe is
what in modern times we call gross matter.
The ancient Hindus called it the <i>Bhutas</i>, the
external elements. There is one element which
according to them is eternal; every other element
is produced out of this one, and this
eternal element is called <i>Âkâsa</i>. It is somewhat
similar to the modern idea of ether,
though not exactly the same. This is the
primal element out of which everything proceeds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
and along with this element there was
something called <i>Prâna</i>: we shall see what it
is as we go on. This <i>prâna</i> and this <i>âkâsa</i>
eternally exist, and they combine and recombine
and form all manifestation. Then at the
end of the cycle everything subsides and goes
back to the unmanifested form of <i>âkâsa</i> and
<i>prâna</i>. There is in the Rig Veda, the oldest
scriptures in existence, a beautiful passage describing
creation, and it is most poetical—“When
there was neither ought nor nought,
when darkness was rolling over darkness, what
existed?” and the answer is given, “It (the
Eternal One) then existed without motion.”
<i>Prâna</i> and <i>âkâsa</i> were latent in that Eternal
One, but there was no phenomenal manifestation.
This state is called <i>Avyaktam</i>, which
literally means “without vibration,” or unmanifested.
At the beginning of a new cycle
of evolution, this <i>avyaktam</i> begins to vibrate
and blow after blow is given by <i>prâna</i> to the
<i>âkâsa</i>. This causes condensation and gradually,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
through the forces of attraction and repulsion,
atoms are formed. These in turn
condense into molecules and finally into the
different elements of Nature.</p>

<p>We generally find these things very curiously
translated; people do not go to the ancient
philosophers or to their commentators for their
translation and have not learning enough to
understand for themselves. They translate the
elements as “air,” “fire,” and so on. If they
would go to the commentators they would find
that they do not mean anything of the sort.
The <i>âkâsa</i>, made to vibrate by the repeated
blows of <i>prâna</i>, produces <i>vâyu</i> or the vibratory
state of the <i>âkâsa</i>, which in turn produces
gaseous matter. The vibrations growing more
and more rapid generate heat, which in Sanskrit
is called <i>tejas</i>. Gradually it is cooled off and
the gaseous substance becomes solid, <i>prithivi</i>.
We had first <i>âkâsa</i>, then came heat, then it
became liquified, and when still more condensed
appeared as solid matter. It goes back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
unmanifested condition in exactly the reverse
way. The solids will be converted into liquid
and the liquid into a mass of heat, that will
slowly go back into the gaseous state, disintegration
of atoms will begin, finally equilibrium
of all forces will be reached, vibration
will stop and the cycle of evolution which in
Sanskrit is called <i>Kalpa</i> is at an end. We
know from modern astronomy that this earth
and sun of ours are undergoing the same transitions,
this solid earth will melt down and
become liquid once more, and will eventually
go back to the gaseous state.</p>

<p><i>Prâna</i> cannot work alone without the help
of <i>âkâsa</i>. All that we know is that motion
or vibration and every movement that we see
is a modification of this <i>prâna</i>, and everything
that we know in the form of matter, either as
form or as resistance, is a modification of this
<i>âkâsa</i>. This <i>prâna</i> cannot exist alone, or act
without a medium, but in every state of it,
whether as pure <i>prâna</i>, or when it changes into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
other forces of nature, say gravitation or centrifugal
attraction, it can never be separate
from <i>âkâsa</i>. You have never seen force without
matter or matter without force; what we
call force and matter being simply the gross
manifestations of these same things, which,
when superfine, we call <i>prâna</i> and <i>âkâsa</i>.
<i>Prâna</i> you can call in English the life, or vital
energy, but you must not restrict it to the life
of man, nor should you identify it with the
spirit, <i>Âtman</i>. Creation is without beginning
and without end; it cannot have either, it is
an eternal on-going.</p>

<p>The next question that comes is rather a
fine one. Some European philosophers have
asserted that this world exists because “I”
exist, and if “I” do not exist, the world will
not exist. Sometimes it is expressed in this
way; they say, if all the people in the world
were to die, and there were no more human
beings, and no animals with powers of perception
and intelligence, all manifestations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
would disappear. It seems paradoxical, but
gradually we shall see clearly that this can be
proved. But these European philosophers do
not know the psychology of it, although they
know the principle; modern philosophy has got
only a glimpse of it.</p>

<p>First we will take another proposition of
these old psychologists which is rather startling,
that the grossest elements are the <i>bhutas</i>,
but that all gross things are the results of fine
ones. Everything that is gross is composed
of a combination of minute things, so the
<i>bhutas</i> must be composed of certain fine particles,
called in Sanskrit the <i>tanmâtras</i>. I
smell a flower; to smell that, something must
come in contact with my nose; the flower is
there and I do not see it move towards me;
but without something coming in contact with
my nose I cannot smell the flower. That which
comes from the flower and into contact with
my nose are the <i>tanmâtras</i>, fine molecules of
that flower, so fine that no diminution can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
perceived in the flower. So with heat, light,
sight, and everything. These <i>tanmâtras</i> can
again be subdivided into atoms. Different
philosophers have different theories, and we
know these are only theories, so we leave them
out of discussion. Sufficient for us that everything
gross is composed of things that are very,
very minute. We first get the gross elements,
which we feel externally, and composing them
are the fine elements, which our organs touch,
which come in contact with the nerves of the
nose, eyes and ears. That ethereal wave which
touches my eyes, I cannot see, yet I know it must
come in contact with my optic nerve before I can
see the light. So with hearing, we can never
see the particles that come in contact with our
ears, but we know that they must be there.
What is the cause of these <i>tanmâtras</i>? A very
startling and curious answer is given by our
psychologists,—self-consciousness. That is the
cause of these fine materials, and the cause of
the organs. What are these organs? Here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
first the eye, but the eye does not see. If the
eyes did see, when a man is dead, and his eyes
are still perfect, they would still be able to see.
There is some change somewhere; something
has gone out of the man, and that something,
which really sees, of which the eye is the instrument,
is called the organ. So this nose is
an instrument, and there is an organ corresponding
to it. Modern physiology can tell
you what that is, a nerve centre in the brain.
The eyes, ears, etc., are simply the external
instruments. It may be said that the organs,
<i>Indriyas</i>, as they are called in Sanskrit, are
the real seats of perception.</p>

<p>What is the use of having one organ for the
nose, and one for the eyes, and so on? Why
will not one serve the purpose? To make it
clear to you,—I am talking, and you are listening,
and you do not see what is going on
around you because the mind has attached
itself to the organ of hearing, and has detached
itself from the sight organ. If there were only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
one organ the mind would hear and see at the
same time, it would see and hear and smell at
the same time, and it would be impossible for it
not to do all three at the same time. Therefore
it is necessary that there should be separate
organs for all these centres. This has
been borne out by modern physiology. It is
certainly possible for us to see and hear at
the same time, but that is because the mind
attaches itself partially to both centres, which
are the organs. What are the instruments?
We see that these are really made of the gross
materials. Here they are,—eyes, nose, and
ears, etc. What are the organs? They are
also made of materials, because they are
centres. Just as this body is composed of gross
material for transforming <i>prâna</i> into different
gross forces, so these finer organs behind, are
composed of the fine elements, for the manufacture
of <i>prâna</i> into the finer forces of perception
and all kindred things. All these
organs or <i>indriyas</i> combined, plus the internal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
instrument or <i>antahkarana</i>, are called the finer
body of man,—the <i>linga</i> (or <i>sûkshma</i>) <i>sarira</i>.</p>

<p>It has a real form, because everything material
must have a form. Behind the <i>indriyas</i>
is what is called the <i>manas</i>, the <i>chitta</i> in <i>vritti</i>,
what might be called the vibratory state of the
mind, the unsettled state. If you throw a stone
into a calm lake, first there will be vibration,
and then resistance. For a moment the water
will vibrate and then it will react on the stone.
So, when any impression comes on the <i>chitta</i>,
or “mind stuff,” it vibrates a little. This state
of the mind is called the <i>manas</i>. Then comes
the reaction, the will. There is another thing
behind this will which accompanies all the acts
of the mind, which is called egoism, the
<i>ahamkâra</i>, the self-consciousness, which says
“I am,” and behind that is what is called
<i>Buddhi</i>, the intellect, the highest form of nature’s
existence. Behind the intellect is the
true Self of man, the <i>Purusha</i>, the pure, the
perfect, who is alone the seer, and for whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
is all this change. The Purusha is looking on
at all these changes; he himself is never impure;
but by implication, what the Vedantists call
<i>adhyâsam</i>, by reflection, he appears to be impure.
It is like a red flower held before a piece
of crystal; the crystal will look red; or a blue
flower and the crystal will look blue; and yet
the crystal itself is colorless. We will take
for granted that there are many selves; each
self is pure and perfect, but it is all these
various divisions of gross matter and fine
matter that are imposing on the self, and making
it variously colored. Why is nature doing
all this? Nature is undergoing all these
changes for the improvement of the soul; all
this creation is for the benefit of the soul, so
that it may be free. This immense book
which we call the universe is stretched before
man so that he may read, and come out, as an
omniscient and omnipotent being. I must here
tell you that some of our best psychologists
do not believe in a personal God in the sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
in which you believe in Him. The real father
of our psychologists, Kapila, denies the existence
of God as a Creator. His idea is that a
personal God is quite unnecessary; Nature itself
is sufficient to work out all that is good. What
is called the “Design” theory he repudiated,
and said a more childish theory was never
advanced. But he admits a peculiar kind of
God; he says we are all struggling to get free,
and when man becomes free he can, as it were,
melt away into Nature for the time being, only
to come out at the beginning of the next cycle
and be its ruler; come out an omniscient and
omnipotent being. In that sense he can be
called God; you and I and the humblest beings
will be gods in different cycles. Kapila says
such a God will be temporal, but an eternal
God, eternally omnipotent and eternally ruler
of the universe, cannot be. If there were such
a God, there would be this difficulty: he must
either be bound or free. A God who is perfectly
free would not create; there would be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
necessity. If he were bound, he would not
create because he could not, he would be weak
himself. So, in either case, there cannot be
an omnipotent or omniscient eternal ruler. So
wherever the word God is mentioned in our
Scriptures, Kapila says it means those perfected
souls who have become free. The
<i>Sânkhya</i> system does not believe in the unity
of all souls. Vedânta believes that all individual
souls are united in one cosmic Being
called <i>Brahman</i>, but Kapila, the founder of the
<i>Sânkhya</i>, was dualistic. His analysis of the
universe so far as it goes is really marvellous.
He was the father of Hindu evolutionists, and
all the later philosophical systems are simply
outcomes of his thought.</p>

<p>According to this system all souls will regain
their freedom and their natural rights, which
are omnipotence and omniscience. Here the
question may be asked, whence is this bondage
of the souls? The <i>Sânkhya</i> says it is without
beginning, but if it be without beginning it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
must also be without end, and we shall never
be free. Kapila explains that this “without
beginning” means not in a constant line. Nature
is without beginning and without end, but
not in the same sense as is the soul, because
Nature has no individuality, just as a river
flowing by us is every moment getting a fresh
body of water, and the sum total of all these
bodies of water is the river, so the river is not
a constant quantity. Similarly everything in
Nature is constantly changing, but the soul
never changes. Therefore as Nature is always
changing, it is possible for the soul to come
out of its bondage. One theory of the <i>Sânkhya</i>
is peculiar to this psychology. The whole
of the universe is built upon the same plan as
one single man, or one little being; so, just as
I have a mind, there is also a cosmic mind.
When this macrocosm evolves there must be
first intelligence, then egoism, then the <i>tanmâtras</i>
and the organs, and then the gross elements.
The whole universe according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Kapila is one body, all that we see are the
grosser bodies, and behind these are the finer
bodies, and behind them, a universal egoism,
and behind that a universal Intelligence, but
all this is <i>in</i> Nature, all this is manifestation of
Nature, not outside of Nature. Each one of
us is a part of that cosmic consciousness. There
is a sum-total of intelligence out of which we
draw what we require, so there is a sum-total
of mental force in the universe out of which
we are drawing eternally, but the seed for the
body must come from the parents. The theory
includes heredity and reincarnation too. The
material is given to the soul out of which to
manufacture a body, but that material is given
by hereditary transmission from the parents.</p>

<p>We come now to that proposition that in this
process there is an involution and an evolution.
All is evolved out of that indiscreet Nature;
and then is involved again and becomes
<i>Avyaktam</i>. It is impossible, according to the
<i>Sânkhyas</i>, for any material thing to exist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
which has not as its material some portion of
consciousness. Consciousness is the material
out of which all manifestation is made. The
elucidation of this comes in our next lecture,
but I will show how it can be proved. I do
not know this table as it is, but it makes an
impression; it comes to the eyes, then to the
<i>indriyas</i>, and then to the mind; the mind then
reacts, and that reaction is what I call the
table. It is just the same as throwing a stone
into a lake; the lake throws a wave against
the stone; this wave is what we know. The
waves coming out are all we know. In the
same way the fashion of this wall is in my
mind; what is external nobody knows; when
I want to know it, it has to become that material
which I furnish; I, with my own mind,
have furnished the material for my eyes, and
the something which is outside is only the
occasion, the suggestion, and upon that suggestion
I project my mind, and it takes the
form of what I see. The question is, how do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
we all see the same things? Because we all
have a part of this cosmic mind. Those who
have mind will see the thing, and those who
have not will not see it. This goes to show
that since this universe has existed there has
never been a want of mind, of that one cosmic
mind. Every human being, every animal, is
also furnished out of that cosmic mind, because
it is always present and furnishing
material for their formation.</p>

<p class="ph3">PRAKRITI AND PURUSHA</p>


<p>We will take up the categories we have been
discussing and come to the particulars. If
we remember we started with <i>Prakriti</i>, or
Nature. This Nature is called by the <i>Sânkhya</i>
philosophers indiscrete or inseparate, which is
defined as perfect balance of the materials in
it; and it naturally follows that in perfect
balance there cannot be any motion. All that
we see, feel, and hear is simply a compound
of motion and matter. In the primal state,
before this manifestation, where there was no
motion, perfect balance, this <i>Prakriti</i> was indestructible,
because decomposition comes only
with limitation. Again, according to the
<i>Sânkhya</i>, atoms are not the primal state. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
universe does not come out of atoms, they may
be the secondary, or tertiary state. The original
matter may compound into atoms, which
in turn compound into greater and greater
things, and as far as modern investigations
go, they rather point towards that. For instance,
in the modern theory of ether, if you
say ether is also atomic, that will not solve
the proposition at all. To make it clearer,
say that air is composed of atoms, and we
know that ether is everywhere, interpenetrating,
omnipresent, and these atoms are floating,
as it were, in ether. If ether again be composed
of atoms, there will still be some space
between two atoms of ether. What fills up
that? And again there will be another space
between the atoms of that which fills up this
space. If you propose that there is another
ether still finer you must still have something
to fill that space, and so it will be <i>regressus in
infinitum</i>, what the <i>Sânkhya</i> philosophers call
<i>anavasthâ</i>,—never reaching a final conclusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
So the atomic theory cannot be final. According
to the <i>Sânkhyas</i> this Nature is omnipresent,
one omnipresent mass of Nature in which are
the causes of everything that exists. What is
meant by cause? Cause is the more subtle state
of the manifested state, the unmanifested state
of that which becomes manifested. What do
you mean by destruction? It is reverting to
the cause,—the materials out of which a body
is composed go back into their original state.
Beyond this idea of destruction, any idea such
as annihilation, is on the face of it absurd.
According to modern physical sciences, it can
be demonstrated that all destruction means
that which Kapila called ages ago “reverting
to the causal state.” Going back to the finer
form is all that is meant by destruction. You
know how it can be demonstrated in a laboratory
that matter is indestructible. Those of
you who have studied chemistry will know
that if you burn a candle and put a caustic
pencil inside a glass tube beneath the candle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
when the candle has burned away, if you take
the caustic pencil out of the tube and weigh
it, you will find that the pencil will weigh exactly
its previous weight, plus the weight of
the candle,—the candle became finer and finer,
and went on to the caustic. So that in this
present stage of our knowledge, if any man
claims that anything becomes annihilated, he
is only making himself absurd. It is only
uneducated people who would advance such a
proposition, and it is curious that modern
knowledge coincides with what those old philosophers
taught. The ancients proceeded in
their inquiry by taking up mind as the basis;
they analyzed the mental part of this universe
and came to certain conclusions, while modern
science is analyzing the physical part, and
it also comes to the same conclusions. Both
analyses must lead to the same truth.</p>

<p>You must remember that the first manifestation
of this <i>Prakriti</i> in the cosmos is what
the <i>Sânkhyas</i> called <i>Mahat</i>. We may call it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
universal intelligence, the great principle; that
is the literal meaning. The first manifestation
of <i>Prakriti</i> is this intelligence; I would not
translate it by self-consciousness, because that
would be wrong. Consciousness is only a part
of this intelligence, which is universal. It
covers all the grounds of consciousness, sub-consciousness
and super-consciousness. In
Nature, for instance, certain changes are going
on before your eyes which you see and understand,
but there are other changes so much
finer that no human perception can catch them.
They are from the same cause, the same <i>Mahat</i>
is making these changes. There are other
changes, beyond the reach of our mind or
reasoning, all this series of changes is in this
<i>Mahat</i>. You will understand it better when
I come to the individual. Out of this <i>Mahat</i>
comes the universal egoism, and these are both
material. There is no difference between matter
and mind save in degree. It is the same
substance in finer or grosser form; one changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
into the other, and this will exactly coincide
with the modern physiological research, and
it will save you from a great deal of fighting
and struggling to believe that you have a mind
separate from the brain, and all such impossible
things. This substance called <i>Mahat</i>
changes into the material egoism, the fine state
of matter, and that egoism changes into two
varieties. In one variety it changes into the
organs. Organs are of two kinds—organs of
sensation and organs of reaction. They are
not the eyes or nose, but something finer, what
you call brain centres, and nerve centres. This
egoism becomes changed, and out of this material
are manufactured these centres and these
nerves. Out of the same substance, the
egoism, is manufactured a yet finer form, the
<i>tanmâtras</i>, fine particles of matter, those for
instance which strike your nose and cause you
to smell. You cannot perceive these fine particles,
you can only know that they are there.
These <i>tanmâtras</i> are manufactured out of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
egoism, and out of these <i>tanmâtras</i>, or subtle
matter, is manufactured the gross matter, air,
water, earth, and all the things that we see
and feel. I want to impress this on your mind.
It is very hard to grasp it, because, in Western
countries, the ideas are so queer about mind
and matter. It is hard to take these impressions
out of our brains. I myself had a tremendous
difficulty, being educated in Western
philosophy in my childhood. These are all
cosmic things. Think of this universal extension
of matter, unbroken, one substance,
undifferentiated, which is the first state of
everything, and which begins to change just
as milk becomes curd, and it is changed into
another substance called <i>Mahat</i>, which in one
state manifests as intelligence and in another
state as egoism. It is the same substance, and
it changes into the grosser matter called
egoism; thus is the whole universe itself built,
as it were, layer after layer; first undifferentiated
Nature (<i>Avyaktam</i>), and that changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
into universal intelligence (<i>Mahat</i>), and that
again is changed into universal egoism
(<i>Ahamkâra</i>), and that changes into universal
sensible matter. That matter changes into
universal sense-organs, again changes into
universal fine particles, and these in turn combine
and become this gross universe. This is
the cosmic plan, according to the <i>Sânkhyas</i>,
and what is in the cosmos or macrocosm, must
be in the individual or microcosm.</p>

<p>Take an individual man. He has first a
part of undifferentiated nature in him, and that
material nature in him becomes changed into
<i>mahat</i>, a small particle of the universal intelligence,
and that small particle of the universal
intelligence in him becomes changed into
egoism—a particle of the universal egoism.
This egoism in turn becomes changed into the
sense-organs, and out of these sense-organs
come the <i>tanmâtras</i>, and out of them he combines
and manufactures his world, as a body.
I want this to be clear, because it is the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
stepping stone to Vedânta, and it is absolutely
necessary for you to know, because this is the
philosophy of the whole world. There is no
philosophy in the world that is not indebted
to Kapila, the founder of this <i>Sânkhya</i> system.
Pythagoras came to India and studied his
philosophy and carried some of these ideas
to the Greeks. Later it formed the Alexandrian
school, and still later formed the basis of
Gnostic philosophy. It became divided into
two parts; one went to Europe and Alexandria,
and the other remained in India, and became
the basis of all Hindu philosophy, for out of
it the system of Vyâsa was developed. This
was the first rational system that the world
saw, this system of Kapila. Every metaphysician
in the world must pay homage to
him. I want to impress on your mind that
as the great father of philosophy, we are bound
to listen to him, and respect what he said.
This wonderful man, most ancient of philosophers,
is mentioned even in the Vedas. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
wonderful his perceptions were! If there is
any proof required of the power of the Yogis
to perceive things beyond the range of the
ordinary senses, such men are the proofs. How
could they perceive them? They had no microscopes,
or telescopes. How fine their perception
was, how perfect their analysis and how
wonderful!</p>

<p>To revert again to the microcosm, man. As
we have seen, he is built on exactly the same
plan. First the nature is “indiscrete” or
perfectly balanced, then it becomes disturbed,
and action sets in and the first change produced
by that action is what is called <i>mahat</i>,—intelligence.
Now you see this intelligence
in man is just a particle of the cosmic intelligence,—the
<i>Mahat</i>. Out of it comes self-consciousness,
and from this the sensory and the
motor nerves, and the finer particles out of
which the gross body is manufactured. I will
here remark that there is one difference between
Schopenhauer and Vedânta. Schopenhauer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
says the desire, or will, is the cause of
everything. It is the will to exist that makes
us manifest, but the Advaitists deny this.
They say it is the intelligence. There cannot
be a single particle of will which is not a reaction.
So many things are beyond will. It
is only a manufactured something out of the
ego, and the ego is a product of something
still higher, the intelligence, and that is a modification
of “indiscrete” Nature, or <i>Prakriti</i>.</p>

<p>It is very important to understand this <i>mahat</i>
in man,—the intelligence. This intelligence
itself is modified into what we call egoism,
and this intelligence is the cause of all these
motions in the body. This covers all the
grounds of sub-consciousness, consciousness
and super-consciousness. What are these three
states? The sub-conscious state we find in
animals, what we call instinct. This is nearly
infallible, but very limited. Instinct almost
never fails. An animal instinctively knows a
poisonous herb from an edible one, but its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
instinct is limited to one or two things; it
works like a machine. Then comes the higher
state of knowledge, which is fallible, makes
mistakes often, but has a larger scope, although
it is slow, and this you call reason. It is much
larger than instinct, but there are more dangers
of mistake in reasoning than in instinct. There
is a still higher state of the mind, the super-conscious,
which belongs only to the Yogis,
men who have cultivated it. This is as infallible
as instinct, and still more unlimited than
reason. It is the highest state. We must
remember that in man this <i>mahat</i> is the real
cause of all that is here, that which is manifesting
itself in various ways, covers the whole
ground of sub-conscious, conscious and super-conscious
states, the three states in which
knowledge exists. So in the Cosmos, this universal
Intelligence, <i>Mahat</i>, exists as instinct,
as reason, and as super-reason.</p>

<p>Now comes a delicate question, which is
always being asked. If a perfect God created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the universe, why is there imperfection in it?
What we call the universe is what we see, and
that is only this little plane of consciousness
or reason, and beyond that we do not see at
all. Now the very question is an impossible
one. If I take up only a bit out of a mass and
look at it, it seems to be imperfect. Naturally.
The universe seems imperfect because we make
it so. How? What is reason? What is
knowledge? Knowledge is finding associations.
You go into the street and see a man,
and know it is a man. You have seen many
men, and each one has made an impression on
your mind, and when you now see this man,
you calmly refer to your store of impressions,
see many pictures of men there, and you put
this new one with the rest, pigeon-hole it and
are satisfied. When a new impression comes
and it has associations in your mind, you are
satisfied, and this state of association is called
knowledge. Knowledge is, therefore, pigeon-holing
one experience with the already existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
fund of experience, and this is one of the
great proofs that you cannot have any knowledge
until you have already a fund in existence.
If you are without experience, or if,
as some European philosophers think, the mind
is a <i>tabula rasa</i>, it cannot get any knowledge,
because the very fact of knowledge is the
recognition of the new by comparison with
already existing impressions. There must be
a store ready to which to refer a new impression.
Suppose a child is born into this world
without such a fund, it would be impossible
for him to get any knowledge. Therefore the
child must have been in a state in which he
had a fund, and so knowledge is eternally
going on. Show me any way of getting out
of this. It is mathematical experience. This
is very much like the Spencerian and other
philosophies. They have seen so far that there
cannot be any knowledge without a fund of
past knowledge. They have drawn out the idea
that the child is born with knowledge. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
say that the cause has entered the effect. It
comes in a subtle form in order to be developed.
These philosophers say that these impressions
with which the child comes, are not from the
child’s own past, but were in his forefathers’;
that it is hereditary transmission. Very soon
they are going to find this theory untenable,
and some of them are now giving hard blows
to these ideas of heredity. Heredity is very
good, but incomplete. It only explains the
physical side. How do you explain the influence
of environment? Many causes produce
one effect. Environment is one of the modifying
causes. On the other hand we in turn
make our own environment, because as our
past was, so we find our present. In other
words, we are what we are here and now, because
of what we have been in the past.</p>

<p>You understand what is meant by knowledge.
Knowledge is pigeon-holing a new
impression with old impressions—recognizing
a new impression. What is meant by recognition?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Finding its association with the similar
impressions that we already have. Nothing
further is meant by knowledge. If that be the
case, it must be that we have to see the whole
series of similars. Is it not? Suppose you
take a pebble; to find the association, you have
to see the whole series of pebbles similar to it.
But with the universe we cannot do that, because
in our reasoning we can only go after
one perception of our universe, and neither see
on this side nor on that side, and we cannot
refer it to its association. Therefore the universe
seems unintelligible, because knowledge
and reason are always finding associations.
This bit of the universe cut off by our consciousness
is a startling new thing, and we
have not been able to find its associations.
Therefore we are struggling with it, and thinking
it is so horrible, so wicked, and bad;—sometimes
we think it is good, but generally
we think it is imperfect. The universe will
be known only when we find the associations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
We shall recognize them when we go beyond
the universe and consciousness, and then the
universe will stand explained. Until we do
that all our fruitless striving will never explain
the universe, because knowledge is the
finding of similars, and this conscious plane
gives us only a partial view. So with our
idea of the universal <i>Mahat</i>, or what in our
ordinary everyday language we call God. All
that we have of God is only one perception,
just as of the universe we see only one portion,
and all the rest is cut off and covered by our
human limitation. “I, the Universal, so great
am I that even this universe is a part of me.”
That is why we see God as imperfect, and we
can never understand Him, because it is impossible.
The only way to understand is to
go beyond reason, beyond consciousness.
“When thou goest beyond the heard and hearing,
the thought and thinking, then alone wilt
thou come to truth.” (Bhagavad Gita II. 52.)
“Go thou beyond the Scriptures, because they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
teach only up to Nature, up to the three qualities.”
(Gita II. 45.) When we go beyond
them we find the harmony, not before.</p>

<p>So far it is clear that this macrocosm and
microcosm are built on exactly the same plan,
and in this microcosm we know only one very
small part. We know neither the sub-conscious,
nor the super-conscious. We know only
the conscious. If a man says “I am a sinner,”
he is foolish, because he does not know himself.
He is the most ignorant of men about
himself; one part only he knows, because the
fact of knowledge covers only one part of the
“mind-ground” he is in. So with this universe;
it is possible to know only one part
through reasoning, but Nature comprises the
whole of it, the sub-conscious, the conscious
and the super-conscious, the individual <i>mahat</i>
and the universal <i>Mahat</i> with all their subsequent
modifications, and these lie beyond
reason.</p>

<p>What makes nature change? We see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Up to this point everything, all <i>Prakriti</i>, is
<i>jadâ</i> (insentient). It is working under law;
it is all compound and insentient. Mind, intelligence,
and will, all are insentient. But
they are all reflecting the sentiency, the <i>Chit</i>
(Intelligence) of some Being who is beyond
all this, and whom the Sânkhya philosophers
call <i>Purusha</i>. This <i>Purusha</i> is the
unwitting cause of all these changes in Nature—in
the universe. That is to say, this
<i>Purusha</i>, taking Him in the universal sense,
is the God of the universe. It is claimed that
the will of the Lord created the universe.
This is very good as a common daily expression,
but that is all. How could it be will?
Will is the third or fourth manifestation in
Nature. Many things exist before it, and
what created <i>them</i>? Will is a compound, and
everything that is a compound is a production
out of Nature. Will itself cannot create Nature.
It is not a simple. So to say that the
will of the Lord created the universe is illogical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Our will only covers a little portion of
self-consciousness, and moves our brain, they
say. If it did you could stop the action of
the brain, but you cannot. It is not the will.
Who moves the heart? It is not the will, because
if it were you could stop it or not at
your will. It is neither will that is working
your body, nor that is working the universe.
But it is something of which will itself is one
of the manifestations. This body is being
moved by the power of which will is only a
manifestation in one part. So in the universe
there is will, but that is only one part of the
universe. The whole of the universe is not
guided by will, that is why we do not find
the explanation in will. Suppose I take it for
granted that the will is moving the body, and
then I begin to fret and fume. It is my fault,
because I had no right to take it for granted
that it was will. In the same way, if I take
the universe and think it is will that moves
it and then find things that do not coincide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
it is my fault. This <i>Purusha</i> is not will,
neither can it be intelligence, because intelligence
itself is a compound. There cannot be
any intelligence without some sort of matter.
In man, this matter takes the form which we
call brain. Wherever there is intelligence there
must be matter in some form or other. But
that intelligence itself is a compound. What
then is this <i>Purusha</i>? It is neither intelligence
nor <i>buddhi</i> (will), but yet it is the cause of
both these; it is His presence that sets them
all vibrating and combining. <i>Purusha</i> may be
likened to some of these substances which by
their mere presence promote chemical reaction,
as in the case of cyanide of potassium which
is added when gold is being smelted. The
cyanide of potassium remains separate and unaffected,
but its presence is absolutely necessary
to the success of the process. So with the
<i>Purusha</i>. It does not mix with Nature: it is
not Intelligence, or <i>Mahat</i>, or any one of these,
but the Self, the Pure, the Perfect. “I am the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Witness, and through My witnessing, Nature
is producing all that is sentient and all that
is insentient.” (Gita IX. 10.)</p>

<p>What is this sentiency in Nature? The
basis of sentiency is in the <i>Purusha</i>, is the
nature of the <i>Purusha</i>. It is that which cannot
be spoken, but which is the material of
all that we call knowledge. This <i>Purusha</i> is
not consciousness, because consciousness is a
compound, but whatever is light and goodness
in this consciousness belongs to It. Sentiency
is in the <i>Purusha</i>, but the <i>Purusha</i> is not intelligent,
not knowing, it is knowledge itself.
The <i>Chit</i> in the <i>Purusha</i>, plus <i>Prakriti</i>, is what
is known to us as intelligence and consciousness.
Whatever is pleasure and happiness and
light in the universe belongs to the <i>Purusha</i>,
but it is a compound because it is that <i>Purusha</i>
plus Nature. “Wherever there is any happiness,
wherever there is any bliss, there is one
spark of that immortality, which is <i>Purusha</i>.”
This <i>Purusha</i> is the great attraction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
universe, untouched by, and unconnected with
the universe, yet it attracts the whole universe.
You see a man going after gold, because therein
is a spark of the <i>Purusha</i>, even though he
knows it not. When a man desires children,
or a woman a husband, what is the attracting
power? That spark of <i>Purusha</i> behind the
child or wife, behind everything. It is there,
only overlaid with matter. Nothing else can
attract. “In this world of insentiency that
<i>Purusha</i> alone is sentient.” This is the
<i>Purusha</i> of the <i>Sânkhyas</i>. As such it necessarily
follows that this <i>Purusha</i> must be omnipresent.
That which is not omnipresent must
be limited. All limitations are caused; that
which is caused must have beginning and end.
If the <i>Purusha</i> is limited it will die, will not
be final, will not be free, but will have been
caused. Therefore if not limited, it is omnipresent.
According to Kapila there are many
<i>Purushas</i>, not one. An infinite number of
them, you are one, I am one, each is one; an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
infinite number of circles, each one infinite,
running through this universe. The <i>Purusha</i> is
neither born nor dies. It is neither mind nor
matter, and the reflex from it is all that
we know. We are sure if it be omnipresent
it knows neither death nor birth. Nature is
casting her shadow upon it, the shadow of
birth and death, but it is by its own nature
eternal. So far we have found the theory of
Kapila wonderful.</p>

<p>Next we will have to take up the proofs
against it. So far the analysis is perfect, the
psychology cannot be controverted. There is
no objection to it. We will ask of Kapila the
question: Who created Nature? and his answer
will be that Nature (<i>Prakriti</i>) is uncreate.
He also says that the <i>Purusha</i> is omnipresent
and that of these <i>Purushas</i> there is an infinite
number. We shall have to controvert this last
proposition, and find a better solution, and by
so doing we shall come to the ground taken by
Vedânta. Our first doubt will be how there can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
be these two infinites. Then our argument
will be that it is not a perfect generalization,
and that therefore we have not found a perfect
solution. And then we shall see how the
Vedantists find their way out of all these difficulties
and reach a perfect solution. Yet all
the glory really belongs to Kapila. It is very
easy to give a finish to a building that is nearly
complete.</p>

<p class="ph3">SÂNKHYA AND ADVAITA</p>


<p>I will give you first a <i>resumé</i> of the
<i>Sânkhya</i> philosophy, through which we have
been going, because in this lecture we want
to find where its defects are, and where Vedânta
comes in as supplementary to these
defects. You must remember that according
to the <i>Sânkhya</i> philosophy, Nature is causing
all these manifestations which we call thought
and intellect, reason, love, hatred, touch, taste;
that everything is from Nature. This Nature
consists of three sorts of elements, one called
<i>Sattva</i>, another <i>Rajas</i>, and the third <i>Tamas</i>.
These are not qualities, but the materials out
of which the whole universe is being evolved,
and at the beginning of a cycle they remain in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
equilibrium. When creation comes this equilibrium
is disturbed and these elements begin
to combine and recombine, and manifest as
the universe. The first manifestation of this
is what the <i>Sânkhya</i> calls the <i>Mahat</i> (universal
Intelligence), and out of that comes
consciousness. And out of consciousness is
evolved <i>Manas</i> (universal Mind). Out of this
consciousness are also evolved the organs of
the senses, and the <i>tanmâtras</i>,—sound particles,
touch particles, taste particles, and so forth.
All fine particles are evolved from this consciousness,
and out of these fine particles come
the gross particles which we call matter. After
the <i>tanmâtras</i> (those particles which cannot
be seen, or measured) come the gross particles
which we can feel and sense. The <i>chitta</i>
(“mind-stuff”) in its three-fold functions of
intellect, consciousness and mind, is working
and manufacturing the forces called <i>prânas</i>.
These <i>prânas</i> have nothing to do with breath,
you must at once get rid of that idea. Breath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
is one effect of the Prâna (universal Energy).
By these <i>prânas</i> are meant the nervous forces
that are governing and moving the whole body,
which are manifesting themselves as thought,
and as the various functions of the body. The
foremost and the most obvious manifestation
of these <i>prânas</i> is the breathing motion. If
it were caused by air, a dead man would
breathe. The <i>prâna</i> acts upon the air, and not
air upon it. These <i>prânas</i> are the vital forces
which manipulate the whole body, and they in
turn are manipulated by the mind and the
<i>indriyas</i> (the two kinds of organs). So far
so good. The psychology is very clear and
most precise, and just think of the age of it,
the oldest rational thought in the world!
Wherever there is any philosophy or rational
thought, it owes something to Kapila. Wherever
there is any attempt at psychology, or
philosophy, there is some indebtedness to the
great father of this thought, to this man
Kapila.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>So far we see that this psychology is wonderful,
but we shall have to differ with it on
some points, as we go on. We find that the
principal idea on which Kapila works is evolution.
He makes one thing evolve out of
another, because his very definition of causation
is “the effect is the cause reproduced in
another form,” and because the whole universe,
so far as we see it, is progressive and evolving.
This whole universe must have evolved out of
some material, out of <i>Prakriti</i> or Nature.
Therefore this Nature cannot be essentially
different from its cause, only when it takes
form it becomes limited. The material itself
is without form. But according to Kapila,
from undifferentiated nature down to the last
stage of differentiation, none of these is the
same as <i>Purusha</i>, the “Enjoyer,” or “Enlightener.”
Just as a lump of clay, so is a mass
of mind, or the whole universe. By itself it
has no light, but we find reason and intelligence
in it, therefore there must be some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Existence behind it, behind the whole of Nature,
whose light is percolating through it and
appearing as <i>Mahat</i> and consciousness and all
these various things, and this Existence is what
Kapila calls the <i>Purusha</i>, the <i>Âtman</i> or Self
of the Vedantist. According to Kapila, the
<i>Purusha</i> is a <i>simple</i> factor, not a compound.
It is immaterial, the only one that is immaterial,
whereas all the various manifestations
are material. The <i>Purusha</i> alone knows.
Suppose I see a blackboard, first the external
instruments will bring that sensation to the
organ (to the <i>indriya</i> according to Kapila),
from the organ it will go to the mind and
make an impression; the mind will cover it up
with another factor,—consciousness, and will
present it to the <i>buddhi</i> (intelligence), but
<i>buddhi</i> cannot act; it is the <i>Purusha</i> behind
that acts. These are all its servants, bringing
the sensation to It, and It gives the orders,
and the <i>buddhi</i> reacts. The <i>Purusha</i> is the
Enjoyer, the Perceiver, the real One, the King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
on his throne, the Self of man, and It is immaterial.
Because It is immaterial, it necessarily
follows that It must be infinite, It cannot have
any limitation whatever. So each one of these
<i>purushas</i> is omnipresent, each is all-pervading,
but can act only through fine and gross manifestations
of matter. The mind, the self-consciousness,
the organs and the vital forces
compose what is called the fine body, or what
in Christian philosophy is called the “spiritual
body” of man. It is this body that comes to
reward or punishment, that goes to the different
heavens; that incarnates and reincarnates;
because we see from the very beginning
that the going and coming of the soul
(<i>Purusha</i>) is impossible. Motion means going
and coming, and that which goes from one
place to another cannot be omnipresent. It is
this <i>linga-sarira</i> (subtle body) which comes
and goes. Thus far we see from Kapila’s
psychology that the soul is infinite, and that
the soul is the only principle that is not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
evolution of Nature. It is the only one that
is outside of Nature, but It has apparently
got bound by Nature. This Nature is around
the <i>Purusha</i> and It has identified Itself with
Nature. It thinks “I am the <i>linga-sarira</i>,” It
thinks “I am the gross matter, the gross body,”
and as such is enjoying pleasure and pain;
but these do not really belong to the soul,
they belong to this <i>linga-sarira</i>, and to the
gross body. When certain nerves are hurt we
feel pain. We recognize that immediately. If
the nerves in our fingers were dead we could
cut the fingers and not feel it. So pleasure
and pain belong to the nerve-centres. Suppose
my organ of sight is destroyed, I do not feel
pleasure or pain from color, although my eyes
are there. So it is obvious that pleasure and
pain do not belong to the soul. They belong
to the mind and the body.</p>

<p>The soul has neither pleasure nor pain; it
is the Witness of everything, the eternal Witness
of things that are going on, but it takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
no fruits from any work. “As the sun is the
cause of sight in every eye, yet is not itself
affected by the defects in any eye; as a piece
of crystal appears red when red flowers are
placed before it, so this <i>Purusha</i> appears to
be affected by pleasure or pain from the reflection
cast upon It by Nature, but it remains
ever unchanged.” The nearest way to describe
Its state is that it is meditation. This meditative
state is that in which you approach
nearest to the <i>Purusha</i>. Thus we see why the
meditative state is always called the highest
state by the <i>Yogi</i>, neither a passive nor an
active state, but the meditative state. This is
the <i>Sânkhya</i> philosophy.</p>

<p>Next, the <i>Sânkhyas</i> say that this manifestation
of Nature is for the soul, all the combinations
are for something outside of Nature.
So these combinations which we call Nature,
these constant changes are going on for the
enjoyment of the soul, for its liberation, that
it may gain all this experience from the lowest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
to the highest, and when it has gained it, the
soul finds that it never was in Nature. It
was entirely separate, and it finds that it is
indestructible, that it neither goes nor comes,
that going to heaven and being born again were
in Nature and not in the soul. So the soul
becomes free. All of Nature is working for
the enjoyment and experience of the soul. It
is getting this experience in order to reach the
goal, and that goal is freedom. These souls
are many, according to the <i>Sânkhya</i> philosophy.
There is an infinite number of souls.
And the other conclusion is that there is no
God, as the Creator of the universe. Nature
herself is sufficient to produce all these forms.
God is not necessary, say the <i>Sânkhyas</i>.</p>

<p>Now we shall have to contest these three
positions of the <i>Sânkhyas</i>. First that intelligence
or anything of that sort does not belong
to the soul, but that it belongs entirely to
Nature; the soul being simply qualitiless, colorless.
The second point is that there is no God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
but Vedânta will show that without a God
there cannot be any explanation whatever.
Thirdly, we shall have to contend that there
cannot be many souls, that there cannot be an
infinite number, that there is only One Soul
in the universe, and that One is appearing as
many.</p>

<p>We will take the first proposition, that intelligence
and reason belong entirely to Nature,
and not to the soul. The Vedânta says that the
soul is in its essence Existence-Knowledge-Bliss;
but we agree with the <i>Sânkhyas</i> that
all that they call intelligence is a compound.
For instance, let us look at our perceptions.
We remember that the <i>chitta</i> (or the “mind-stuff”)
is what is combining all these things,
and upon which all these impressions are made,
and from which reactions come. Suppose
there is something outside. I see the blackboard.
How does the knowledge come? The
blackboard itself is unknown, I can never know
it. It is what the German philosophers call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the “thing in itself.” That blackboard, that
“X,” is acting on my mind, and the <i>chitta</i>
reacts. The <i>chitta</i> is like a lake; throw a stone
upon it, and as soon as the stone strikes it a
reactionary wave comes towards the stone.
This wave is what you really know. And
this wave is not like the stone at all, it is a
wave. So that blackboard, “X,” is the stone
which strikes the mind and the mind throws
up a wave towards that object which strikes
it, and this wave which is thrown towards it
is what we call the blackboard. I see you.
You as reality are unknown and unknowable.
You are “X” and you act upon my mind, and
the mind throws a wave towards the point
from which the action came, and that wave
is what I call Mr. or Mrs. So-and-So.</p>

<p>There are two elements in this, one from
inside and the other from outside, and the
combination of these two, “X” plus mind, is
our external universe. All knowledge is by
reaction. In the case of a whale it has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
determined by calculation how long after its
tail is struck, its mind reacts upon the tail
and the tail feels the pain. Take the case of
the pearl oyster, in which the pearl is formed
by the oyster throwing its own juice around
the grain of sand that enters the shell and
irritates him. There are two things which
cause the pearl. First the oyster’s own juice,
and second the blow from outside. So this
table is “X” plus my mind. The very attempt
to know it will be made by the mind; therefore
the mind will give some of its own substance
to enable it to understand, and when
we understand it, it has become a compound
thing,—“X” plus the mind. Similarly in internal
perception; when we want to know ourselves.
The real Self, which is within us, is
also unknown and unknowable. Let us call
it “Y.” When I want to know myself as Mr.
So-and-So it is “Y” plus the mind. That “Y”
strikes a blow on the mind, and when I want
to know myself I must throw a blow upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
mind also. So our whole world is “X” plus
mind (the external world), and “Y” plus
mind (the internal world). We shall see later
how this Advaitist idea can be demonstrated
mathematically.</p>

<p>“X” and “Y” are simply the algebraic unknown
quantities. We have seen that all
knowledge is a combination, and this world,
the universe, is a combination, and intelligence
is similarly a combination. If it is internal
intelligence it is “Y” plus the mind, if an external
object, it is “X” plus the mind. Knowledge
is a combination of “Y” plus the mind
and matter is a combination of “X” plus the
mind. We first take the internal group. Intelligence
which we see in Nature cannot be
wholly in Nature, because intelligence itself
is a compound of “Y” plus the mind. “Y”
comes from the Self. So the intelligence that
we know is a compound of the power of the
light of the soul plus nature. Similarly, the
existence which we know must be a compound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
of “X” plus the mind. We find therefore that
in these three factors, I exist, I know and I
am blessed, the idea that I have no want, which
comes from time to time, is the central idea,
the grand basic idea of our life, and when it
becomes limited, and becomes a compound, we
think it happiness and misery. These factors
manifest as existence phenomenal, knowledge
phenomenal, and love phenomenal. Every man
exists, and every man must know, and every
man is made for bliss. He cannot help it. So
through all existence; animals and plants, from
the lowest to the highest existence, all must
love. You may not call it love; but they must
all exist, must all know and must all love. So
this existence which we know is a compound
of “X” and the mind, and knowledge also is
a compound of that “Y” inside plus mind, and
that love also is a compound of that “Y” and
mind. Therefore these three factors which
come from inside and are combining themselves
with the external things to manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
phenomenal existence, knowledge and love, are
called by the Vedantists “Existence Absolute,
Knowledge Absolute, Bliss Absolute.”</p>

<p>That Absolute Existence which is limitless,
which is unmixed, uncombined, which knows
no change, is the free soul, and that Real Existence,
when it gets mixed up, muddled up,
as it were, with the elements of Nature is what
we call human existence. It is limited and
manifests as plant life, animal life, human life,
just as infinite space is apparently limited by
the walls of this room, or by any other enclosure.
That Knowledge Absolute means not
the knowledge we know, not intelligence, not
reason, not instinct, but that which when it
becomes manifested we call by these names.
When that Knowledge Absolute becomes limited
we call it intuition, and when it becomes
still more limited we call it reason, instinct,
etc. That Knowledge Absolute is <i>Vijnâna</i>.
The nearest translation of it is “all-knowingness.”
There is no combination in it. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the nature of the soul. That Bliss Absolute
when it becomes limited we call love, attraction
for the gross body, or the fine bodies, or
for ideas. These are but distorted manifestations
of this blessedness which is not a quality
of the soul, but the essence, the inherent nature
of the soul. Absolute Existence, Absolute
Knowledge, and Absolute Blessedness are not
qualities of the soul, but its essence; there is
no difference between them and the soul. And
the three are one; we see the one thing in three
different lights. They are beyond all knowledge
and by their reflection Nature appears to
be intelligent.</p>

<p>It is that eternal Knowledge Absolute of the
Self percolating through the mind of man that
becomes our reason and intelligence. It varies
according to the medium through which it is
shining. There is no difference as soul between
me and the lowest animal, only his brain
is a poorer medium through which the knowledge
shines, and we call it instinct. In man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the brain is much finer, so the manifestation
is much clearer, and in the highest man it has
become entirely clear, like a piece of glass.
So with existence; this existence which we
know, this limited bit of existence is simply a
reflection of that Existence Absolute which is
the nature of the soul. So with bliss; that
which we call love or attraction is but the reflection
of the eternal blessedness of the Self,
because with these manifestations come limitations,
but the unmanifested, the natural, essential
existence of the soul is unlimited, to that
blessedness there can be no limit. But in
human love there are limitations. I may love
you one day, I may cease to love you the next.
My love increases one day, decreases the next,
because it is only a limited manifestation. The
first thing therefore that we find against
Kapila is that he conceives the soul to be a
mere qualitiless, colorless, inactive something.
Vedânta teaches that it is the essence of all
Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss; infinitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
higher than all knowledge that we know, infinitely
more blessed than any human love that
we can think of, infinitely existing. The soul
never dies. Death and birth are simply unthinkable
in connection with the Self, because
it is Existence Absolute.</p>

<p>The second point where we will contend
with Kapila is with regard to his idea of God.
Just as this series of limited manifestations of
Nature, beginning with the individual intellect
and ending with the individual body, requires
the Self behind as the ruler and governor on
the throne, so in the Cosmos, we must enquire
what the universal Intelligence, the universal
Mind, the universal fine and gross materials
have as their ruler and governor? How will
that series become complete without one universal
Self behind it as its ruler and governor?
If we deny that there is a universal governor,
we must deny there is a soul behind the lesser
series, because the whole universe is a repetition
of the same plan. When we know one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
lump of clay we know the nature of all clay.
If we can analyze one human being, we shall
have analyzed the whole universe, because it
is all built on the same plan. Therefore if it
be true that behind this individual series there
stands one who is beyond all nature, who is
not composed of materials, the <i>purusha</i>, the
very same logic will apply to this universe,
and this universe too will require such a Soul.
The Universal Soul which is behind the modifications
of Nature is called by Vedânta <i>Isvara</i>,
the Supreme Ruler, God.</p>

<p>Now comes the more difficult point to fight.
There can be but one Soul. To begin with,
we can give the <i>Sânkhyas</i> a good blow by
taking up their theories and proving that each
soul must be omnipresent, because it is not
composed of anything. Everything that is
limited must be limited by something else.
Here is the existence of the table. Its existence
is circumscribed by many things, and we
find that every limitation presupposes some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
limiting thing. If we think of space, we have
to think of it as a little circle, but beyond that
is more space. We cannot imagine a limited
space in any other way. It can only be understood
and perceived through the infinite. To
perceive the finite, in every case we must apprehend
the infinite; both stand or fall together.
When you think of time, you have also to think
of time beyond any particular period of time.
The latter is limited time and the larger is
unlimited time. Wherever you endeavor to
perceive the finite, you will find it impossible
to separate it from the infinite. If this be the
case, we shall prove thereby that this Self must
be infinite, omnipresent. Then comes a fine
question. Can the omnipresent, the infinite be
two? Suppose there are two infinites, one will
limit the other. Suppose there are two infinites,—A
and B; the infinite “A” limits the
infinite “B,” because the infinite “B” you can
say is not the infinite “A,” and the infinite “A”
it can be said is not the infinite “B.” Therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
there can be but one infinite. Secondly,
the infinite cannot be divided. Infinity divided
into any number of parts must still be infinity,
for it cannot be separated from itself. Suppose
there is an infinite ocean of water, could
you take up one drop from there? If you
could, that ocean would no longer be infinite,
that drop would limit it. The infinite cannot
be divided by any means.</p>

<p>But there are stronger proofs that the Self
is One. Not only so, but that the whole universe
is one. We will once more take up our
“X” and “Y”. We have shown how what we
call the external world is “X” plus mind, and
the internal world “Y” plus mind. “X” and
“Y” are both unknown quantities, unknown
and unknowable. What is the mind? The
mind is the “time, space and causation.” This
idea is the nature of the mind. You can never
think without time, you can never conceive
of anything without space, and you can never
imagine anything without causation. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
three are the forms in which both “X” and
“Y” are caught, and which become the mind.
Beyond that there is nothing to the mind.
Take off these three forms which of themselves
do not exist,—what remains? It is all
one; “X” and “Y” are one. It is only this
mind, this form, that has limited them apparently,
and made them differ as internal and
external world. “X” and “Y” are both unknown
and unknowable. We cannot attribute
any quality to them. As such they are both
the same. That which is qualitiless and attributeless
and absolute must be one. There
cannot be two absolutes. When there are no
qualities there can be only One. “X” and “Y”
are both without qualities because they take
qualities only in the mind, therefore this “X”
and “Y” are one.</p>

<p>The whole universe is One. There is only
One Self in the universe, only One Existence,
and that One Existence, when it is passing
through the forms of time, space and causation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
is called <i>buddhi</i>, fine matter, gross matter,
etc. All physical and mental forms, everything
in the universe is that One, appearing
in various ways. When a little bit of it gets
into this network of time, space and causation,
it apparently takes forms; remove the network
and it is all One. This whole universe
is all one, and is called in the Advaitist philosophy
<i>Brahman</i>. <i>Brahman</i> appearing behind
the universe is called God; appearing behind
the little universe—the microcosm, is the soul.
This very “Self” or Âtman therefore is God
in man. There is only one <i>Purusha</i>, and He
is called God, and when God and man are
analyzed they are one. The universe is you
yourself, the unbroken you; you are throughout
this universe. “In all hands you work,
through all mouths you eat, through all nostrils
you breathe, through all minds you think.”
The whole universe is you; this universe is
your body; you are the universe, both formed
and unformed. You are the soul of the universe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
its body also. You are God, you are
the angels, you are man, you are the animals,
you are the plants, you are the minerals, you
are everything; all manifestation is you.
Whatever exists is you—the <i>real</i> “You”—the
one undivided Self—not the little, limited personality
that you have been regarding as yourself.</p>

<p>The question now arises,—how have you,
that Infinite Being, broken into parts, become
Mr. So-and-So, and the animals and so on?
The answer is that all this division is only
apparent. We know that the infinite cannot
be divided, therefore this idea that you are a
part has no reality, and never will have: and
this idea that you are Mr. So-and-So was never
true at any time; it is but a dream. Know this
and be free. That is the Advaitist conclusion.
“I am neither the mind, nor the body, nor am
I the organs; I am Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute; I am He, I am He,” This
is knowledge, and everything besides this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
ignorance. Everything that is, is but ignorance,
the result of ignorance. Where is
knowledge for me, for I am knowledge
itself! Where is life for me, for I am
life itself! Life is a secondary manifestation
of my nature. I am sure I live, for I
am life, the one Being, and nothing exists
except through me, and in me, and as me. I
am manifested through elements, but I am the
one free. Who seeks freedom? Nobody
seeks freedom. If you think that you are
bound, you remain bound; you make your own
bondage. If you realize that you are free, you
are free this moment. This is knowledge,
knowledge of freedom. Freedom is the goal
of all Nature.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FREE SOUL</p>


<p>We have seen that the analysis of the
<i>Sânkhyas</i> stops with the duality of existence,
Nature and souls. There are an infinite number
of souls, which, being simple, cannot die, and
must therefore be separate from Nature. Nature
in itself changes and manifests all these
phenomena, and the soul, according to the
<i>Sânkhyas</i> is inactive. It is a simple by itself,
and Nature works out all these phenomena
for the liberation of the soul, and liberation
consists in the soul discriminating that it is
not Nature. At the same time we have seen
that the <i>Sânkhyas</i> were bound to admit that
every soul was omnipresent. Being a simple
the soul cannot be limited, because all limitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
comes either through time, space, or causation.
The soul being entirely beyond these
cannot have any limitation. To have limitation
one must be in space, which means the body,
and that which is body must be in Nature. If
the soul had form, it would be identified with
Nature; therefore the soul is formless, and
that which is formless cannot be said to exist
here, there, or anywhere. It must be omnipresent.
Beyond this the <i>Sânkhya</i> philosophy
does not go.</p>

<p>The first argument of the Vedantists against
this is that this analysis is not a perfect one.
If this Nature be a simple, and the soul is also
a simple, there will be two simples, and all the
arguments that apply in the case of the soul
to show that it is omnipresent, will apply in
the case of Nature, and Nature too will be
beyond all time, space, and causation, and as
the result there will be no change or manifestation.
Then will come the difficulty of having
two simples, or two absolutes, which is impossible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
What is the solution of the Vedantist?
His solution is that, just as the
<i>Sânkhyas</i> say, it requires some sentient being
as the motive power behind, which makes the
mind think and Nature work, because Nature
in all its modifications, from gross matter up
to <i>Mahat</i> (Intelligence) is simply insentient.
Now, says the Vedantist, this sentient being
which is behind the whole universe is what we
call <i>God</i>, and consequently this universe is not
different from Him. It is He Himself who
has become this universe. He not only is the
instrumental cause of this universe, but also
the material cause. Cause is never different
from effect, the effect is but the cause reproduced
in another form. We see that every
day. So this Being is the cause of Nature.
All the forms and phases of Vedânta, either
dualistic, or qualified-monistic, or monistic,
first take this position,—that God is not only
the instrumental but also the efficient cause of
this universe, that everything which exists is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
He. The second step in Vedânta is that these
souls are also a part of God, one spark of that
Infinite Fire. “As from a mass of fire millions
of small particles fly, even so from this Ancient
One have come all these souls.” So far so
good, but it does not yet satisfy. What is
meant by a part of the Infinite? The Infinite
is indivisible; there cannot be parts of the Infinite.
The Absolute cannot be divided. What
is meant therefore that all these sparks are
from Him? The Advaitist, the non-dualistic
Vedantist, solves the problem by maintaining
that there is really no part; that each soul is
really not a part of the Infinite, but actually
<i>is</i> the Infinite <i>Brahman</i>. Then how can there
be so many? The sun reflected from millions
of globules of water appears to be millions of
suns, and in each globule is a miniature picture
of the sun-form; so all these souls are but
reflections and not real. They are not the real
“I” which is the God of this universe, the one
undivided Being of the universe. And all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
little different beings, men and animals, etc.,
are but reflections, and not real. They are
simply illusory reflections upon Nature. There
is but one Infinite Being in the universe, and
that Being appears as you and as I, but this
appearance of division is after all delusion.
He has not been divided, but only appears to
be divided. This apparent division is caused
by looking at Him through the network of
time, space, and causation. When I look at
God through the network of time, space, and
causation, I see Him as the material world.
When I look at Him from a little higher plane,
yet through the same network, I see Him as
an animal, a little higher as a man, a little
higher as a god, but yet He is the One Infinite
Being of the universe, and that Being we are.
I am That, and you are That. Not parts of It,
but the whole of It. “It is the Eternal Knower
standing behind the whole phenomena; He
Himself is the phenomena.” He is both the
subject and the object, He is the “I” and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
“You.” How is this? “How to know the
knower?” The Knower cannot know himself.
I see everything but cannot see myself. The
Self, the Knower, the Lord of all, the Real
Being, is the cause of all the vision that is in
the universe, but it is impossible for Him to
see Himself or know Himself, excepting
through reflection. You cannot see your own
face excepting in a mirror, and so the Self
cannot see its own nature until it is reflected,
and this whole universe therefore is the Self
trying to realize Itself. This reflection is
thrown back first from the protoplasm, then
from plants and animals, and so on and on
from better and better reflectors, until the best
reflector,—the perfect man,—is reached. Just
as a man who, wanting to see his face, looks
first in a little pool of muddy water, and sees
just an outline. Then he comes to clearer
water, and sees a better image, then to a piece
of shining metal, and sees a still better image,
and at last to a looking-glass, and sees himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
reflected as he is. Therefore the perfect man
is the highest reflection of that Being, who is
both subject and object. You now find why
man instinctively worships everything, and
how perfect men are instinctively worshipped
as God in every country. You may talk as
you like, but it is they who are bound to be
worshipped. That is why men worship Incarnations,
such as Christ or Buddha. They are
the most perfect manifestations of the eternal
Self. They are much higher than all the conceptions
of God that you or I can make. A
perfect man is much higher than such conceptions.
In him the circle becomes complete;
the subject and the object become one. In him
all delusions go away and in their place comes
the realization that he has always been that
perfect Being. How came this bondage then?
How was it possible for this perfect Being to
degenerate into the imperfect? How was it
possible that the free became bound? The
<i>Advaitist</i> says he was never bound, but was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
free. Various clouds of various colors
come before the sky. They remain there a
minute and then pass away. It is the same
eternal blue sky stretching there forever. The
sky never changes; it is the cloud that is
changing. So you are always perfect, eternally
perfect. Nothing ever changes your nature,
or ever will. All these ideas that I am imperfect,
I am a man, or a woman, or a sinner, or
I am the mind, I have thought, I will think,
all are hallucinations; you never think, you
never had a body; you never were imperfect.
You are the blessed Lord of this universe, the
one Almighty ruler of everything that is and
ever will be, the one mighty ruler of these suns
and stars and moons and earths and plants,
and all the little bits of our universe. It is
through you the sun shines, and the stars shed
their lustre, and the earth becomes beautiful.
It is through your blessedness that they all love
and are attracted to each other. You are in
all, and you are all. Whom to avoid, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
whom to take? You are the all in all. When
this knowledge comes delusion immediately
vanishes.</p>

<p>I was once travelling in the desert in India.
I travelled for over a month and always found
the most beautiful landscapes before me, beautiful
lakes and all that. One day I was very
thirsty and I wanted to have a drink at one
of these lakes, but when I approached that lake
it vanished. Immediately with a blow came
into my brain the idea that this was a mirage
about which I had read all my life, and then
I remembered and smiled at my folly, that for
the last month all the beautiful landscapes and
lakes I had been seeing were this mirage, but
I could not distinguish them then. The next
morning I again began my march; there was
the lake and the landscape, but with it immediately
came the idea, “This is a mirage.”
Once known it had lost its powers of illusion.
So this illusion of the universe will break one
day. The whole of this will vanish, melt away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
This is realization. Philosophy is no joke or
talk. It will be realized; this body will vanish,
this earth and everything will vanish, this idea
that I am the body, or the mind, will for some
time vanish, or if the <i>Karma</i> is ended it will
disappear never to come back; but if one part
of the <i>Karma</i> remains,—as a potter’s wheel
after the potter has finished the pot, will sometimes
go on from the past momentum—so this
body, when this delusion has vanished altogether,
will go on for some time. Again this
world will come, men and women and animals
will come, just as the mirage came the next
day, but not with the same force, along with
it will come the idea that I know its nature
now, and it will cause no bondage, no more
pain, nor grief, nor misery. Whenever anything
miserable will come, the mind will be
able to say, “I know you as hallucination.”
When a man has reached that state he is called
<i>jivan mukta</i>, “living free,” free even while
living. The aim and end in this life for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
<i>Jnâna Yogi</i> is to become this <i>jivan mukta</i>,
living freedom. He is <i>jivan mukta</i> who can
live in this world without being attached. He
is like the lotus leaves in water, which are
never wet by the water. He is the highest of
human beings, nay, the highest of all beings,
for he has realized his identity with the Absolute,
he has realized that he is one with God.
So long as you think you have the least difference
from God, fear will seize you, but when
you have known that you are He, that there
is no difference, entirely no difference, that you
are He, all of Him, and the whole of Him, all
fear ceases. “There who sees whom? Who
worships whom? Who talks to whom? Who
hears whom? Where one sees another, where
one talks to another, where one hears another,
it is in law. Where none sees none, where
none speaks to none that is the highest, that is
the great, that is the <i>Brahman</i>.” Being That,
you are always That. What will become of
the world then? What good shall we do to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the world? Such questions do not arise.
“What becomes of my gingerbread if I become
old?” says the baby. “What becomes of my
marbles if I grow, so I will not grow,” says
the boy. “What will become of my dolls if
I grow old?” says the little child. It is the
same question in connection with this world;
it has no existence in the past, present, or
future. If we have known the <i>Âtman</i> as It
is, if we have known that there is nothing else
but this <i>Âtman</i>, that everything else is but a
dream, with no existence in reality, then this
world with its poverties, its miseries, its wickedness
and its goodness will cease to disturb
us. If they do not exist, for whom and for
what shall we take trouble? This is what the
<i>Jnâna Yogis</i> teach. Therefore, dare to be free,
dare to go as far as your thought leads, and
dare to carry that out in your life. It is very
hard to come to <i>jnânam</i>. It is for the bravest
and most daring, who dare to smash all idols,
not only intellectual, but in the senses. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
body is not I; it must go. All sorts of curious
things may come out of this. A man stands
up and says I am not the body, therefore my
headache must be cured, but where is the headache
if not in his body? Let a thousand headaches
and a thousand bodies come and go.
What is that to me? “I have neither birth nor
death; father nor mother I never had; friends
and foes I have none, because they are all I;
I am my own friend and I am my own enemy;
I am Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute;
I am He, I am He.” If in a thousand bodies
I am suffering from fever and other ills, in millions
of bodies I am healthy. If in a thousand
bodies I am starving, in other thousand bodies I
am feasting. If in thousands of bodies I am
suffering misery, in thousands of bodies I am
happy. Who shall blame whom, who praise
whom? Whom to seek, whom to avoid? I
seek none, nor avoid any, for I am all the
universe, I praise myself, I blame myself, I
suffer for myself, I am happy at my own will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
I am free. This is the <i>Jnâni</i>, brave and daring.
Let the whole universe tumble down; he smiles
and says it never existed. It was all an hallucination;
we see the universe tumble down;
where was it? Where has it gone?</p>

<p>Before going into the practical part, we will
take up one more intellectual question. So
far the logic is tremendously rigorous. If
man reasons, there is no place for him to stand
until he comes to this, that there is but One
Existence, that everything else is nothing.
There is no other way left for rational mankind
but to take this view. But how is it that what
is infinite, ever perfect, ever blessed, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute has come under
these delusions? It is the same question that
has been asked all the world over. In the vulgar
form the question becomes “How did sin
come into this world?” This is the most vulgar
and sensuous form of the question, and the
other is the more philosophic form, but the
answer is the same. The same question has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
been asked in various grades and fashions, but
in its lower forms it finds no solution, because
the stories of apples and serpents and women
do not give the explanation. In that state, the
question is childish and so is the answer. But
the question has assumed very high proportions
now. “How this illusion came?” And
the answer is as fine. The answer is that we
cannot expect any answer to an impossible
question. The very question is impossible in
terms. You have no right to ask that question.
Why? What is perfection? That which is
beyond time, space and causation. That is
perfect. Then you ask how the perfect became
imperfect. In logical language the question
may be put in this form—“How did that which
is beyond causation become caused?” You
contradict yourself. You first admit it is beyond
causation, and then ask what causes it.
This question can only be asked within the
limits of causation. As far as time and space
and causation extend, so far can this question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
be asked. But beyond that it will be nonsense
to ask it, because the question is illogical.
Within time, space and causation it can never
be answered, and what answer may lie beyond
these limits can only be known when we have
transcended them, therefore the wise will let
this question rest. When a man is ill, he devotes
himself to curing his disease, without
insisting that he must first learn how he came
to have it.</p>

<p>There is another form of this question, a
little lower, but more practical and illustrative.
What produced this delusion? Can any reality
produce delusion? Certainly not. We see that
one delusion produces another, and so on. It
is delusion always that produces delusion. It
is disease that produces disease, and not health
that produces disease. The wave is the same
thing as the water, the effect is the cause in
another form. The effect is delusion, and
therefore the cause must be delusion. What
produced this delusion? Another delusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
And so on without beginning. The only question
that remains for you to ask is, does not
this break your monism, because you get two
existences in the universe, one yourself, and
the other the delusion? The answer is,—delusion
cannot be called an existence. Thousands
of dreams come into your life, but do not form
any part of your life. Dreams come and go;
they have no existence; to call delusion existence
will be sophistry. Therefore there is only
one individual existence in the universe, ever
free, and ever blessed, and that is what you
are. This is the last conclusion reached by the
<i>Advaitists</i>. It may then be asked, what becomes
of all these various forms of worship?
They will remain; they are simply groping in
the dark for light, and through this groping
light will come. We have just seen that the
Self cannot see Itself. Our knowledge is within
the network of <i>Mâyâ</i> (unreality), and beyond
that is freedom; within the network there is
slavery, it is all under law. Beyond that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
is no law. So far as the universe is concerned,
existence is ruled by law, and beyond that is
freedom. As long as you are in the network
of time, space and causation, to say you are
free is nonsense, because in that network all
is under rigorous law, sequence and consequence.
Every thought that you think is
caused, every feeling has been caused; to say
that the will is free is sheer nonsense. It is
only when the infinite existence comes, as it
were, into this network of <i>Mâyâ</i> that it takes
the form of will. Will is a portion of that
being caught in the network of <i>Mâyâ</i>, and
therefore “free-will” is a misnomer. It means
nothing,—sheer nonsense. So is all this talk
about freedom. There is no freedom in <i>Mâyâ</i>.</p>

<p>Every one is as much bound in thought,
word, deed, and mind, as a piece of stone or
this table. That I talk to you now is as rigorously
in causation as that you listen to me.
There is no freedom until you go beyond <i>Mâyâ</i>.
That is the real freedom of the soul. Men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
however sharp and intellectual, however clearly
they see the force of the logic that nothing here
can be free, are all compelled to think they are
free; they cannot help. No work can go on
until we begin to say we are free. It means
that the freedom we talk about is the glimpse
of the blue sky through the clouds, and that
the real freedom—the blue sky itself,—is behind.
True freedom cannot exist in the midst
of this delusion, this hallucination, this nonsense
of the world, this universe of the senses,
body and mind. All these dreams, without
beginning or end, uncontrolled and uncontrollable,
ill-adjusted, broken, inharmonious, form
our idea of this universe. In a dream, when
you see a giant with twenty heads chasing you,
and you are flying from him, you do not think
it is inharmonious; you think it is proper and
right. So is this law. All that you call law
is simply chance without meaning. In this
dream state you call it law. Within <i>Mâyâ</i>,
so far as this law of time, space and causation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
exists, there is no freedom, and all these various
forms of worship are within this <i>Mâyâ</i>. The
idea of God and the ideas of brute and of
man are within this <i>Mâyâ</i>, and as such equally
hallucinations; all of them are dreams. But
you must take care not to argue like some
extraordinary men of whom we hear at the
present time. They say the idea of God is a
delusion, but the idea of this world is true.
Both ideas stand or fall by the same logic. He
alone has the right to be an atheist who denies
this world, as well as the other. The same
argument is for both. The same mass of delusion
extends from God to the lowest animal,
from a blade of grass to the Creator. They
stand or fall by the same logic. The same
person who sees falsity in the idea of God
ought also to see it in the idea of his own body,
or his own mind. When God vanishes, then
also vanish the body and mind, and when both
vanish, that which is the Real Existence remains
forever. “There the eyes cannot go, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the speech, nor the mind. We cannot see it,
neither know it.” And we now understand
that so far as speech and thought and knowledge,
and intellect go, it is all within this
<i>Mâyâ</i>, within bondage. Beyond that is Reality.
There neither thought, nor mind, nor
speech, can reach.</p>

<p>So far it is intellectually all right, but then
comes the practice. The real work in these
classes is the practice. Are any practices
necessary to realize this one-ness? Most decidedly.
It is not that you become this
<i>Brahman</i>. You are already that. It is not
that you are going to become God or perfect;
you are already perfect, and whenever you
think you are not, it is a delusion. This delusion
which says that you are Mr. So-and-So,
or Mrs. So-and-So, can be got rid of by another
delusion, and that is practice. Fire will eat
fire, and you can use one delusion to conquer
another delusion. One cloud will come and
brush away another cloud, and then both will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
go away. What are these practices then? We
must always bear in mind that we are not going
to be free, but are free already. Every idea
that we are bound is a delusion. Every idea
that we are happy or unhappy, is a tremendous
delusion; and another delusion will come,—that
we have got to work and worship and
struggle to be free,—and this will chase out
the first delusion, and then both will stop.</p>

<p>The fox is considered very unholy by the
Mohammedans, also by the Hindus. Also, if
a dog touches any bit of food it has to be
thrown out, it cannot be eaten by any man.
In a certain Mohammedan house a fox entered
and took a little bit of food from the table,
ate it up and fled. The man was a poor man,
and had prepared a very nice feast for himself,
and that feast was made unholy, and he could
not eat it. So he went to a <i>Mulla</i>, a priest,
and said: “This has happened to me; a fox
came and took a mouthful out of my meal;
what can be done? I had prepared a feast and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
wanted so much to eat it, and now comes this
fox and destroys the whole affair.” The
<i>Mulla</i> thought for a minute, and then found
only one solution and said: “The only way is
for you to get a dog, and make him eat a bit
out of the same plate, because dog and fox are
eternally quarrelling. The food that was left by
the fox will go into your stomach, and that not
eaten by the dog will go there, and both will
be purified.” We are very much in the same
Predicament. This is an hallucination that we
are imperfect, and we take up another, that
we have to practice to become perfect. Then
one will chase the other, as we can use one
thorn to extract another and then throw both
away. There are people for whom it is sufficient
knowledge to hear, “Thou art That.”
With a flash this universe goes away and the
real nature shines, but others have to struggle
hard to get rid of this idea of bondage.</p>

<p>The first question is, who are fit to become
<i>Jnâna Yogis</i>? Those who are equipped with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
these requisites. First, renunciation of all
fruits of work and of all enjoyments in this
life or another life. If you are the creator of
this universe whatever you desire you will have,
because you will create it for yourself. It is
only a question of time. Some get it immediately;
with others the past <i>samskâras</i> (impressions)
stand in the way of getting their
desires. We give the first place to desires for
enjoyment, either in this or another life. Deny
there is any life at all, because life is only
another name for death. Deny that you are a
living being. Who cares for life? Life is
one of these hallucinations and death is its
counterpart. Joy is one part of these hallucinations,
and misery the other part, and so on.
What have you to do with life or death? These
are all creations of the mind. This is called
giving up desires of enjoyment either in this
life or another.</p>

<p>Then comes controlling the mind, calming it
so that it will not break into waves and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
all sorts of desires; holding the mind steady,
not allowing it to get into waves from external
or internal causes, controlling the mind perfectly
just by the power of will. The <i>Jnâna
Yogi</i> does not take any one of these physical
helps, or mental helps, simply philosophic
reasoning, knowledge and his own will, these
are the instrumentality he believes in. Next
comes <i>Titikshâ</i>, forbearance, bearing all miseries
without murmuring, without complaining.
When an injury comes, do not mind it.
If a tiger comes, stand there. Who flies?
There are men who practice <i>titikshâ</i>, and succeed
in it. There are men who sleep on the
banks of the Ganges in the mid-summer sun
of India, and in winter float in the waters of
the Ganges for a whole day; they do not care.
Men sit in the snow of the Himâlayas, and do
not care to wear any garment. What is heat?
What is cold? Let things come and go, what
is that to me, I am not the body. It is hard
to believe this in these Western countries, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
it is better to know that it is done. Just as
your people are brave to jump at the mouth
of a cannon, or into the midst of the battle-field,
so our people are brave to think and act
out their philosophy. They give up their lives
for it. “I am Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute; I am He; I am He.” Just as the
Western ideal is to keep up luxury in practical
life, so ours is to keep up the highest form of
spirituality, to demonstrate that religion is not
merely frothy words, but can be carried out,
every bit of it, in this life. This is <i>titikshâ</i>,
to bear everything, not to complain of anything.
I myself have seen men who say “I
am the soul; what is the universe to me?
Neither pleasure, nor pain, nor virtue, nor vice,
nor heat, nor cold are anything to me.” That
is <i>titikshâ</i>; not running after the enjoyments
of the body. What is religion? To pray:
“give me this and that”? Foolish ideas of religion!
Those who believe them have no true
idea of God and soul. My Master used to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the vulture rises high and high until he becomes
a speck, but his eye is always in the
piece of rotten carrion on the earth. After
all, what is the result of your ideas of religion?
To cleanse the streets, and have more bread
and clothes. Who cares for bread and clothes?
Millions come and go every minute. Who
cares? Why care for the joys and vicissitudes
of this little world? Go beyond that if you
dare; go beyond law, let the whole universe
vanish, and stand alone. “I am Existence-Absolute,
Knowledge-Absolute, Bliss-Absolute; I
am He; I am He.”</p>

<p class="ph3">ONE EXISTENCE APPEARING AS
MANY</p>


<p>We have seen how <i>Vairâgyam</i>, or renunciation,
is the turning point in all these various
<i>Yogas</i>. The <i>Karmi</i> (worker) renounces the
fruits of his work. The <i>Bhakta</i> (devotee)
renounces all little loves for the almighty and
omnipresent love. The <i>Yogi</i> renounces his
experiences, because his philosophy is that the
whole Nature, although it is for the experience
of the soul, at last brings him to know that he
is not in Nature, but eternally separate from
Nature. The <i>Jnâni</i> (philosopher) renounces
everything, because his philosophy is that Nature
never existed, neither in the past, present
nor future. We have also seen how the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
of utility cannot be asked in these higher
themes; it is very absurd to ask utility, and
even if it be asked, after a proper analysis what
do we find in this question of utility? The
ideal of happiness, that which brings man
greater happiness is of greater utility to him
than those things which do not improve his
material conditions or bring him such great
happiness. All the sciences are for this one
end, to bring happiness to humanity and that
which brings the larger amount of happiness,
mankind takes and gives up that which brings
a lesser amount of happiness. We have seen
how happiness is either in the body, or in the
mind, or in the <i>Âtman</i>. With animals, and in
the lowest of human beings, who are very much
like animals, happiness is all in the body. No
man can eat with the same pleasure as a famished
dog, or a wolf; so, in the dog and the
wolf the happiness is gone entirely into the
body. In men we find a higher plane of happiness,
that of thought, and in the <i>Jnâni</i> there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
is the highest plane of happiness in the Self,
the <i>Âtman</i>. So to the philosopher this knowledge
of the Self is of the highest utility, because
it gives him the highest happiness possible.
Sense gratifications or physical things
cannot be of the highest utility to him because
he does not find in them the same pleasure that
he finds in knowledge itself; and after that,
knowledge is the one goal, and is really the
highest happiness that we know. All who
work in ignorance are, as it were, the draught
animals of the <i>devas</i>. The word <i>deva</i> is here
used in the sense of a wise man. All the
people that work, and toil, and labor like machines
do not really enjoy life, but it is the
wise man who enjoys. A rich man buys a
picture at a cost of a hundred thousand dollars
perhaps, but it is the man who understands
art that enjoys it; and if a man is without
knowledge of art it is useless to him, he is only
the owner. All over the world, it is the wise
man who enjoys the happiness of the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
The ignorant man never enjoys; he has to
work for others unconsciously.</p>

<p>Thus far we have seen the theories of these
Advaitist philosophers, how there is but one
<i>Âtman</i>; there cannot be two. We have seen
how in the whole of this universe there is but
One Existence, and that One Existence when
seen through the senses is called the world, the
world of matter. When It is seen through the
mind It is called the world of thoughts and
ideas, and when It is seen as it is, then It is
the One Infinite Being. You must bear this
in mind; it is not that there is a soul in man,
although I had to take that for granted in
order to explain it at first, but that there is
only One Existence, and that one the <i>Âtman</i>,
the Self, and when this is perceived through
the senses, through sense imageries, It is called
the body. When It is perceived through
thought, It is called the mind. When It is perceived
in Its own nature, It is the <i>Âtman</i>, the
One Only Existence. So, it is not that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
are three things in one, the body and the mind
and the Self, although that was a convenient
way of putting it in the course of explanation;
but all is that <i>Âtman</i>, and that one Being is
sometimes called the body, sometimes the mind,
and sometimes the Self, according to different
vision. There is but one Being which the
ignorant call the world. When a man goes
higher in knowledge he calls the very same
Being the world of thought. Again when
knowledge itself comes, all illusions vanish, and
man finds it is all nothing but <i>Âtman</i>. I am that
One Existence. This is the last conclusion.
There are neither three nor two in the universe;
it is all One. That One, under the illusion of
<i>Mâyâ</i> is seen as many, just as a rope is seen
as a snake. It is the very rope that is seen as
a snake. There are not two things there, a
rope separate and a snake separate. No man
sees two things there. Dualism and non-dualism
are very good philosophic terms, but
in perfect perception we never perceive the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and the false at the same time. We are all born
monists, we cannot help it. We always perceive
the one. When we perceive the rope, we
do not perceive the snake at all, and when we
see the snake, we do not see the rope at all; it
has vanished. When you see illusion, you do
not see real men. Suppose one of your friends
is coming from a distance in the street; you
know him very well, but through the haze and
mist that is before you, you think it is another
man. When you see your friend as another
man, you do not see your friend at all, he has
vanished. You are perceiving only one. Suppose
your friend is Mr. A., but when you
perceive Mr. A. as Mr. B. you do not see
Mr. A. at all. In each case you perceive only
one. When you see yourself as a body, you
are body and nothing else, and that is the perception
of the vast majority of mankind. They
may talk of soul and mind, and all these things,
but what they perceive is the physical form, the
touch, taste, vision, and so on. Again, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
certain men, in certain states of consciousness,
they perceive themselves as thought. You
know, of course, the story told of Sir Humphrey
Davy, who was making experiments before
his class with laughing-gas, and suddenly
one of the tubes broke, and the gas escaping,
he breathed it in. For some moments he remained
like a statue. Afterwards he told his
class that when he was in that state, he actually
perceived that the whole world is made up of
ideas. The gas, for a time, made him forget
the consciousness of the body, and that very
thing which he was seeing as the body, he
began to perceive as ideas. When the consciousness
rises still higher, when this little
puny consciousness is gone forever, that which
is the Reality behind shines, and we see it as
the One Existence-Knowledge-Bliss, the one
<i>Âtman</i>, the Universal. “One that is only
knowledge itself, One that is bliss itself, beyond
all compare, beyond all limit, ever free, never
bound, infinite as the sky, unchangeable as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
sky. Such an One will manifest Himself in
your heart in meditation.”</p>

<p>How does the Advaitist theory explain all
these various phases of heavens and hells and
all these various ideas we find in all religions?
When a man dies it is said that he goes to
heaven or hell, goes here or there, or that when
a man dies he is born again in another body,
either in heaven or in another world, or somewhere.
These are all hallucinations. Nobody
is ever born or dies, really speaking. There
is neither heaven nor hell, nor this world; all
three never really existed. Tell a child a lot
of ghost stories, and let him go out into the
street in the evening. There is a little stump
of a tree. What does the child see? A ghost,
with hands stretched out, ready to grab him.
Suppose a man comes from the corner of the
street, wanting to meet his sweetheart; he sees
that stump of the tree as the girl. A police-man
coming from the street corner sees the
stump as a thief. The thief sees it as a police-man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
It is the same stump of a tree that was
seen in various ways. The stump is the reality,
and the visions of the stump are the projections
of the various minds. There is one Being,
this Self; It neither comes nor goes. When a
man is ignorant, he wants to go to heaven or
some place, and all his life he has been thinking
and thinking of this, and when this earth
dream vanishes he sees this world as a heaven,
with <i>devas</i> and angels flying about, and all
such things. If a man all his life desires to
meet his forefathers he gets them all, from
Adam downwards, because he creates them.
If a man is still more ignorant and has always
been frightened by fanatics with ideas of hell,
when he dies he will see this very world as hell,
with all sorts of punishments. All that is
meant by dying or being born is simply changes
in the plane of vision. Neither do you move,
nor does that move upon which you project
your vision. You are the permanent, the unchangeable.
How can you go and come? It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
is impossible; you are omnipresent. The sky
never moves, but the clouds move over the
surface of the sky, and we may think that the
sky itself moves. Just as you go into a railway
train, and you think the land is moving. It is
not so, but it is the train which is moving.
You are where you are; this dream, these
various clouds move. One dream follows another
without connection. There is no such
thing as law or connection in this world, but
we are thinking that there is a great deal of
connection. All of you have probably read
“Alice in Wonderland.” It is the most wonderful
book for children written in this century.
When I read it I was delighted, it was always
in my head to write that sort of a book for
children. What pleased me most in it was
what you think most incongruous, that there is
no connection there. One idea comes and
jumps into another, without any connection.
When you were children you thought that the
most wonderful connection. So this man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
brought back his thoughts of childhood, perfectly
connected to him as a child, and composed
this book for children. And all these
books which men write, trying to make children
swallow their own ideas as men are nonsense.
We too are grown up children, that is all. The
world is the same unconnected thing,—“Alice
in Wonderland,”—with no connection whatever.
When we see things happen a number
of times in a certain sequence, we call it cause
and effect, and say that the thing will happen
again. When this dream changes another
dream will seem quite as connected as this.
When we dream, the things we see all seem
to be connected; during the dream we never
think they are incongruous; it is only when we
wake that we see the want of connection.
When we wake from this dream of the world
and compare it with the Reality, it will be found
all incongruous nonsense, a mass of incongruity
passing before us, we do not know whence or
whither, but we know it will end; and this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
called <i>Mâyâ</i>, and is like masses of fleeting,
fleecy clouds. They represent all this changing
existence, and the sun itself, the unchanging,
is you. When you look at that unchanging
Existence from the outside, you call it God,
and when you look at it from the inside you
call it yourself. It is but one. There is no
God separate from you, no God higher than
you, the real “you.” All the gods are little
beings to you, all the ideas of God and Father
in heaven are but your reflection. God Himself
is your image. “God created man after His
own image.” That is wrong. Man creates
God after his own image. That is right.
Throughout the universe we are creating gods
after our own image. We create the god, and
fall down at his feet and worship; and when
this dream comes, we love it!</p>

<p>This is a good point to understand,—that
the sum and substance of this morning’s lecture
is that there is but One Existence, and that One
Existence seen through different constitutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
appears either as the earth, or heaven, or hell,
or God, or ghosts, or men or demons, or world,
or all these things. But among these many
“He who sees that One in this ocean of death,
he who sees that One Life in this floating universe,
who realizes that One who never changes,
unto him belongs eternal peace; unto none else,
unto none else.” This One Existence has to
be realized. How, is the next question. How
is it to be realized? How is this dream to be
broken, how shall we wake up from this dream
that we are little men and women, and all such
things? We are the Infinite Being of the universe,
and have become materialized into these
little beings, men and women, depending upon
the sweet word of one man, or the angry word
of another man and so forth. What a terrible
dependence, what a terrible slavery! I who
am beyond all pleasure and pain, whose reflection
is the whole universe, little bits of whose
life are the suns and moons and stars,—I am
held down as a terrible slave. If you pinch my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
body I feel pain. If one says a kind word I
begin to rejoice. See my condition,—slave of
the body, slave of the mind, slave of the world,
slave of a good word, slave of a bad word,
slave of passion, slave of happiness, slave of
life, slave of death, slave of everything. This
slavery has to be broken. How? “This <i>Âtman</i>
has first to be heard, then reasoned upon and
then meditated upon.” This is the method of
the Advaita <i>Jnâni</i>. The truth has to be heard,
then reflected upon and then to be constantly
asserted. Think always—“I am <i>Brahman</i>”;
every other thought must be cast aside as weakening.
Cast aside every thought that says that
you are men or women. Let body go, and mind
go, and gods go, and ghosts go. Let everything
go but that One Existence. “Where
one hears another, where one sees another, that
is but small; where one does not hear another,
where one does not see another, that is infinite.”
That is the highest, when the subject
and the object become one. When I am the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
listener and I am the speaker, when I am the
teacher and I am the taught, when I am the
creator and I am the created,—then alone fear
ceases; there is not another to make us afraid.
There is nothing but myself, what can frighten
me? This is to be heard day after day. Get
rid of all other thoughts. Everything else
must be thrown aside, and this is to be repeated
continually, poured through the ears until it
reaches the heart, until every nerve and muscle,
every drop of blood tingles with the idea that
I am He, I am He. Even at the gate of death
say “I am He.” There was a man in India, a
<i>Sannyâsin</i>, who used to repeat “<i>Shivoham</i>”
(“I am Bliss Eternal”), and a tiger jumped on
him one day and dragged him away and killed
him, and as long as he was living the sound
came “<i>Shivoham, Shivoham</i>.” Even at the
gate of death, in the greatest danger, in the
thick of the battle-field, at the bottom of the
ocean, on the tops of the highest mountains,
in the thickest of the forest, tell yourself “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
am He, I am He.” Day and night say “I
am He.” It is the greatest strength; it is religion.
“The weak will never reach the
<i>Âtman</i>.” Never say: “O Lord, I am a miserable
sinner.” Who shall help you? You are
the help of the universe. What in this universe
can help you? Where is the man, or the god,
or the demon to help you? What can prevail
over you? You are the god of the universe;
where can you seek for help? Never help
came from anywhere but from yourself. In
your ignorance, every prayer that you made
and that was answered, you thought was answered
by some Being, but you answered the
prayer yourself, unknowingly. The help came
from yourself, and you fondly imagined that
some one was sending help to you. There is
no help for you outside of yourself; you are
the creator of the universe. Like the silkworm
you have built a cocoon around yourself. Who
will save you? Cut your own cocoon and come
out as the beautiful butterfly, as the free soul.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Then alone you will see Truth. Ever tell yourself
“I am He.” These are words that will burn
up the dross that is in the mind, words that
will bring out the tremendous energy which is
within you already, the infinite power which is
sleeping in your heart. This is to be brought
out by constantly hearing the truth and nothing
else. Wherever there is thought of weakness,
approach not the place. Avoid all weakness
if you want to be <i>Jnâni</i>.</p>

<p>Before you begin to practise, clear your
mind of all doubts. Fight and reason and
argue, and when you have established it in
your mind that this and this alone can be the
truth and nothing else, do not argue any more;
close your mouth. Hear not argumentation,
neither argue yourself. What is the use of
any more arguments? You have satisfied
yourself, you have decided the question. What
remains? The truth has now to be realized,
therefore why waste valuable time in vain
arguments? The truth has now to be meditated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
upon and every idea that strengthens you must
be taken up and every thought that weakens
you must be rejected. The <i>Bhakta</i> meditates
upon forms and images and all such things and
upon God. This is the natural process, but a
slower one. The <i>Yogi</i> meditates upon various
centres in his body and manipulates powers in
his mind. The <i>Jnâni</i> says the mind does not
exist, neither the body. This idea of the body
and of the mind must go, must be driven off;
therefore it is foolish to think of them. It
would be like trying to cure one ailment by
bringing in another. His meditation therefore
is the most difficult one, the negative; he denies
everything, and what is left is the Self. This
is the most analytical way. The <i>Jnâni</i> wants to
tear away the universe from the Self by the
sheer force of analysis. It is very easy to say,
“I am a <i>Jnâni</i>,” but very hard to really be one.
“The way is long; it is, as it were, walking on
the sharp edge of a razor, yet despair not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Awake, arise, and stop not until the goal is
reached,” say the Vedas.</p>

<p>So what is the meditation of the <i>Jnâni</i>? He
wants to rise above every idea of body or mind,
to drive away the idea that he is the body.
For instance, when I say “I, Swâmi,” immediately
the idea of the body comes. What
must I do then? I must give the mind a hard
blow and say, “No, I am not the body, I am
the Self.” Who cares if disease comes or
death in the most horrible form? I am not
the body. Why make the body nice? To enjoy
the illusion once more? To continue the
slavery? Let it go, I am not the body. That
is the way of the <i>Jnâni</i>. The <i>Bhakta</i> says:
“The Lord has given me this body that I may
safely cross the ocean of life and I must cherish
it until the journey is accomplished.” The
<i>Yogi</i> says: “I must be careful of the body so
that I may go on steadily and finally attain
liberation.” The <i>Jnâni</i> feels that he cannot
wait, he must reach the goal this very moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
He says: “I am free through eternity, I am
never bound; I am the God of the universe
through all eternity. Who shall make me perfect?
I am perfect already.” When a man
is perfect he sees perfection in others. When
he sees imperfection, it is his own mind projecting
itself. How can he see imperfection
if he has not got it in himself? So the <i>Jnâni</i>
does not care for perfection or imperfection.
None exists for him. As soon as he is free,
he does not see good and evil. Who sees evil
and good? He who has it in himself. Who
sees the body? He who thinks he is the body.
The moment you get rid of the idea that you
are the body, you do not see the world at all.
It vanishes forever. The <i>Jnâni</i> seeks to tear
himself away from this bondage of matter by
the force of intellectual conviction. This is
the negative way,—the “<i>neti, neti</i>” (“not this,
not this”).</p>

<p class="ph3">UNITY OF THE SELF</p>


<p>To illustrate the conclusion arrived at in our
last lesson, I will read to you from one of the
Upanishads, showing how these ideas were
taught in India from the most ancient times.</p>

<p><i>Yajnavalkya</i> was a great sage. You know
the rule in India was that every man must
give up the world when he became old. So
<i>Yajnavalkya</i> said to his wife: “My beloved,
here is all my money and my possessions, and
I am going away.” She replied: “Sir, if I
had this whole earth full of wealth would that
give me immortality?” <i>Yajnavalkya</i> said:
“No, that cannot be. Your life will be that of
the rich, and that will be all, but wealth cannot
give you immortality.” She replied: “That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
through which I shall become immortal, what
shall I do to gain that? If you know that, tell
me.” <i>Yajnavalkya</i> replied: “You have always
been my beloved; you are more beloved
now by this question. Come, take your seat,
and I will tell you, and when you have heard,
meditate upon it.” He continued: “It is not
for the sake of the husband that the wife loves
the husband, but for the sake of the <i>Âtman</i>
(the Self) that she loves the husband, because
she loves the Self. None loves the wife for
the sake of the wife, but it is because he loves
the Self that he loves the wife. None loves the
children for the sake of the children, but because
he loves the Self, therefore he loves the
children. None loves wealth on account of the
wealth, but because he loves the Self, therefore
he loves wealth. None loves the Brahmin for
the sake of the Brahmin, but because he loves
the Self, he loves the Brahmin. So none loves
the <i>Kshatriya</i> for the sake of the <i>Kshatriya</i>,
but because he loves the Self. Neither does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
anyone love the world on account of the world,
but because he loves the Self. None similarly
loves the gods on account of the gods, but because
he loves the Self. None loves anything
for that thing’s sake, but it is for the Self of
that thing that he loves it. This Self therefore,
is to be heard, is to be reasoned, and is
to be meditated upon. Oh my <i>Maitreyi</i>, when
that Self has been heard, when that Self has
been seen, when that Self has been realized,
then all these things become known.”</p>

<p>What does this mean? Before us we find a
curious philosophy. That the Self shines
through all these various things which we call
the world. The statement has been made that
every love is selfishness in the lowest sense of
the word; because I love myself, therefore I
love another; it cannot be. There have been
philosophers in modern times who have said
that self is the only motive power in the
world. That is true, and yet it is wrong. This
self is but the shadow of that real Self which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
is behind. It appears wrong and evil because
it is limited. That very love we have for the
Self, which is the universe, appears to be evil,
because it is seen through limitation. Even
when a wife loves a husband, whether she
knows it or not, she loves the husband for that
Self. It is selfishness as it is manifested in the
world, but that selfishness is really but a small
part of that “Self-ness.” Whenever one loves,
one has to love in and through the Self.</p>

<p>This Self has to be known. Those that love
the Self without knowing what It is, their love
is selfishness. Those that love knowing what
that Self is, their love is free, they are
sages. None loves the Brahmin for the
Brahmin, but because he loves the Self,
which is appearing through the Brahmin.
“Him the Brahmin gives up who sees the
Brahmin as separate from the Self. Him
the <i>Kshatriya</i> gives up who sees the <i>Kshatriya</i>
as separate from the Self. The world gives
him up who sees this world as separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
from the Self. The gods give him up who
believes the gods to be separate from the Self.
All things give him up who knows them as
separate from the Self. These Brahmins, these
<i>Kshatriyas</i>, this world, these gods, whatever
exists, everything is that Self.” Thus <i>Yajnavalkya</i>
explains what he means by that love.
The difficulty comes when we particularize this
love. Suppose I love a woman; as soon as that
woman is particularized, is separated, from that
<i>Âtman</i> (the Self), my love will not be eternal;
it has become selfish and is likely to end in
grief, but as soon as I see that woman as the
<i>Âtman</i>, that Love becomes perfect, and will
never suffer. So, as soon as you are attached
to anything in the universe detaching it from
the universe as a whole—from the <i>Âtman</i>—then
comes a reaction. With everything that
we love outside the Self, grief and misery will
be the result. If we enjoy everything in the
Self, and as the Self, no misery or reaction
will come. This is perfect bliss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>How to come to this ideal? <i>Yajnavalkya</i>
goes on to tell us the process by which to reach
that state. The universe is infinite; how can
we take every particular thing and look at it as
the <i>Âtman</i>, without knowing the <i>Âtman</i>?
“With a drum, when we are at a distance, we
cannot conquer the sound by trying to control
the sound waves, but as soon as we come to the
drum, and put our hand on it, the sound is
conquered. When the conch shell is being
blown, we cannot conquer the sound, until we
come near and get hold of the shell, and then
it is conquered. When the vina is being
played, as soon as we come to the vina, we can
control the centre of the sound, whence the
sound is proceeding. As when some one is
burning damp fuel, all sorts of smoke and
sparks of various kinds rise, even so from this
great One has been breathed out history and
knowledge; everything has come out of Him.
He breathed out, as it were, all knowledge.
As to all water the one goal is the ocean, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
to all touch the hand is the one centre, as to
all smell the nose is the one centre, as of all
taste the tongue is the one centre, as of all
form the eyes are the one centre, as of
all sounds the ears are the one centre, as of all
thought the mind is the one centre, as of all
knowledge the heart is the one centre, as of
all work the hands are the one centre, as of all
speech the organ of speech is the one centre,
as the concentrated salt is through and through
the waters of the sea, yet not to be seen by
the eyes; even so, oh <i>Maitreyi</i>, is this <i>Âtman</i>
not to be seen by the eyes, yet He permeates
this universe. He is everything. He is concentrated
knowledge. The whole universe rises
from Him, and again goes down unto Him.
Reaching Him, we go beyond knowledge.”
We here get the idea that we have all come
just like sparks from Him, and that when we
know Him then we go back, and become one
with Him again.</p>

<p><i>Maitreyi</i> became frightened, just as everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
people become frightened. She said:
“Sir, here is exactly where you have thrown a
confusion over me. You have frightened me
by saying there will be no more gods; all individuality
will be lost. When I reach that
stage shall I know that <i>Âtman</i>, shall I reach
the unconscious state and lose my individuality,
or will the knowledge remain with me that I
know Him? Will there be no one to recognize,
no one to feel, no one to love, no one to hate?
What will become of me?” “O <i>Maitreyi</i>!”
replied her husband, “think not that I am
speaking of an unconscious state, neither
be frightened. This <i>Âtman</i> is indestructible,
eternal in His essence; the stage where there
are two is a lower one. Where there are two
there one smells another, one sees another, one
hears another, one welcomes another, one
thinks of another, one knows another. But
when the whole has become that <i>Âtman</i>, who
is to be smelled by whom, who is to be seen by
whom, who is to be heard by whom, who is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
be welcomed by whom, who is to be known by
whom? Who can know Him by whom everything
is known? This <i>Âtman</i> can only be
described as “<i>neti, neti</i>” (not this, not this).
Incomprehensible, He cannot be comprehended
by the intellect. Unchangeable, He never
fades. Unattached, He never gets mixed up
with Nature. Perfect, He is beyond all pleasure
and pain. Who can know the Knower?
By what means can we know Him? By no
means; this is the conclusion of the sages, O
<i>Maitreyi</i>! Going beyond all knowledge, is to
attain Him and to attain immortality.”</p>

<p>So far the idea is, that it is all One Infinite
Being, that is the Real Individuality, when
there is no more division, no more parts and
parcels, no more such low and illusory ideas.
And yet, in and through every part of this
little individuality is shining that Infinite, the
Real Individuality. Everything is a manifestation
of the <i>Âtman</i>. How to reach to that?
<i>Yajnavalkya</i> told us in the beginning that—“This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
<i>Âtman</i> is first to be heard, then to be
reasoned, then to be meditated upon.” Thus
far he has spoken about the Self, the <i>Âtman</i>,
as being the essence of everything in this universe.
Then reasoning on the Infinite nature
of that Self and the finite nature of the human
mind he comes to the conclusion that it is impossible
for the finite mind to know the
Knower of all—the Self. What is to be done
then if we cannot know the Self? <i>Yajnavalkya</i>
tells <i>Maitreyi</i> that It can be realized, although
It cannot be known, and he enters upon a discourse
as to how It is to be meditated upon.
This universe is helpful to every being and
every being is also helping this universe, for
they are both part and parcel of each other, the
development of the one helps the development
of the other; but to the <i>Âtman</i>, the self-effulgent
One, nothing can be helpful because It is
perfect and infinite. All that is bliss, even in
the lowest sense, is but the reflection of It. All
that is good is the reflection of that <i>Âtman</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and when that reflection is less clear it is called
evil. When the <i>Âtman</i> is less manifested it is
called darkness—evil, and when it is more manifested
it is called light—goodness. That is
all. This good and evil are only a question of
degree, the <i>Âtman</i> more manifested or less
manifested. Just take the example of our own
lives. How many things we see in our childhood
which we think to be good, but which
really are evil, and how many things seem to
be evil which are good? How our ideas
change! How an idea becomes higher and
higher! What we thought very good at one
time, we do not think so good now. Thus
good and evil depend on the development of
our minds, and do not exist objectively. The
difference is only in the degree. All is a manifestation
of that <i>Âtman</i>; It is being manifested
in everything, only when the manifestation is
very poor we call it evil, and when it is clearer
we call it good. That <i>Âtman</i> Itself is beyond
both good and evil. So everything that is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the universe is first to be meditated upon as all
good, because it is a manifestation of that perfect
One. He is neither evil nor good; He is
perfect and the perfect can be only one. The
good can be many, and the evil many, there
will be degrees of variation between the good
and the evil; but the perfect is only one, and
that perfect One when seen through certain
covering we call different degrees of good, and
when seen through other covering we call evil.
Our ideas of good and evil as two distinct
things are mere superstition. There is only
more good and less good and the less good we
call evil. These mistaken ideas of good and
evil have produced all sorts of dualistic delusions.
They have gone deep into the hearts
of human beings, terrorizing men and women
in all ages. All the hatred with which we hate
others is caused by these foolish ideas which
we have imbibed since our childhood. Our
judgment of humanity becomes entirely false;
we make this beautiful earth a hell, but as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
as we can give up these false ideas of good
and evil, it will become a heaven.</p>

<p>“This earth is blissful (‘sweet’ is the literal
translation) to all beings, and all beings are
sweet to this earth; they all help each other.
And all this sweetness is the <i>Âtman</i>, that
effulgent, immortal One.” That one sweetness
is manifesting itself in various ways.
Wherever there is any love, any sweetness in
any human being, either in a saint or a sinner,
either in an angel or a murderer, either in the
body or the mind or the senses, it is all He.
How can there be anything but the One?
Whatever is the lowest physical enjoyment is
He, and the highest spiritual enjoyment is also
He. There is no sweetness but He. Thus
says <i>Yajnavalkya</i>. When you come to that
state, and look upon all things with the same
eyes; when you see in the drunkard’s pleasure
in drink only that sweetness, or in the saints’
meditation only that sweetness, then you have
got the truth, and then alone you will know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
what happiness means, what peace means, what
love means. But as long as you make these
vain distinctions, silly, childish, foolish superstitions,
all sorts of misery will come. But
that immortal One, the effulgent One, He is
the background of the whole universe, it is
all His sweetness. This body is a miniature
universe, as it were; and through all the powers
of the body, all the enjoyments of the mind,
shines that effulgent One. That self-effulgent
One who is in the body, He is the <i>Âtman</i>.
“This world is so sweet to all beings, and every
being is so sweet to it!” But the self-effulgent
One, the Immortal is the bliss in this world.
In us also, He is that bliss. He is the <i>Brahman</i>.
“This air is so sweet to all beings, and all
beings are so sweet to this air.” But He who
is that self-effulgent immortal Being in the air,
He is also in this body. He is expressing
Himself as the life of all beings. “This sun
is so sweet to all beings, and all beings are so
sweet to this sun.” He who is the self-effulgent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
Being in the sun, Him we reflect as smaller
lights. What can there be but His reflection?
He is in the body, and it is His reflection which
makes us see the light. “This moon is so
sweet to all beings, and all beings are so sweet
to this moon.” But that self-effulgent and
immortal One who is the soul of that moon,
He is in us expressing himself as mind. “This
lightning is so sweet to all beings and all
beings are sweet to this lightning,” but the
self-effulgent and immortal One is the soul of
this lightning, and is also in us, because all is
that <i>Brahman</i>. This <i>Brahman</i>, this <i>Âtman</i>,
this Self, is the King of all beings. These ideas
are very helpful to men; they are for meditation.
For instance, meditate on the earth, think
of the earth, at the same time knowing that we
have in us that which is in the earth, that both
are the same. Identify the body with the earth,
and identify the soul with the Soul behind.
Identify the air with the soul that is in the air
and that is in you and so on. All these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
one, manifested in different forms. To realize
this unity is the end and aim of all meditation,
and this is what <i>Yajnavalkya</i> was trying to
explain to <i>Maitreyi</i>.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE HIGHEST IDEAL OF JNÂNA
YOGA</p>


<p>As this is the last of these classes it is better
that I give a brief <i>resumé</i> of all that I have
been trying to tell you. In the Vedas and
Upanishads we find records of some of the
very earliest religious ideas of the Hindus,
ideas that long antedated the time of Kapila,
ancient as this great sage is. He did not propound
the <i>Sânkhya</i> philosophy as a new theory
of his own. His task was to throw the light
of his genius on the vast mass of religious
theories that were existing in his time and
bring out a rational and coherent system. He
succeeded in giving India a psychology that is
accepted to the present day by all the diverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and seemingly opposing philosophical systems
to be found among the Hindus. His masterly
analysis and his comprehensive statement of
the processes of the human mind have not yet
been surpassed by any later philosopher and
he undoubtedly laid the foundation for the
Advaita philosophy, which accepted his conclusions
as far as they went and then pushed them
a step farther, thus reaching a final unity beyond
the duality that was the last word of
the <i>Sânkhyas</i>.</p>

<p>Among the religious ideas that preceded the
time of Kapila the first groups that we see
coming up,—I mean among recognized religious
ideas, and not the very low ones, which
do not deserve the name of religion,—all
include the idea of inspiration, and revealed
book and so forth. In the earliest step, the
idea of creation is very peculiar; it is that the
whole universe is created out of zero, at the
will of God; that all this universe did not
exist, and out of nothingness all this has come.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
In the next stage we find this conclusion is
questioned. The first step in Vedânta asks
this question: How can existence be produced
out of non-existence? If this universe is existent
it must have come out of something,
because it was easy for them to see that there
is nothing coming out of nothing anywhere.
All work that is going on by human hands
requires materials. Naturally, therefore, the
ancient Hindus rejected the first idea that this
world was created out of nothing, and sought
some material out of which this world was
created. The whole history of religion, in fact,
is this search for material. Out of what has
all this been produced? Apart from the question
of the efficient cause, or God, apart from
the question whether God created the universe,
the great question of all questions has been,
out of what did God create it? All the philosophies
are turning, as it were, on this
question.</p>

<p>One solution is that nature and God and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
soul are eternal existences, as if three parallel
lines are running eternally, of which nature
and soul comprise what they call the dependent,
and God the independent Being. Every soul,
like every particle of matter, is perfectly dependent
on the will of God. These and many
other ideas we find already existing when the
<i>Sânkhya</i> psychology was brought forward by
Kapila. According to it, perception comes by
the transmission of the suggestion, which
causes perception first to the eyes, from the
eyes to the organs, from the organs to the
mind, the mind to the <i>buddhi</i> and from the
<i>buddhi</i> to something which is a unit, which
they call the <i>Âtman</i>. Coming to modern physiology
we know that they have found centres
for all the different sensations. First are found
the lower centres, then a higher grade of
centres, and these two will exactly correspond
with the actions of the <i>buddhi</i> and the <i>manas</i>
(mind), but not one centre has been found
which controls all the other centres, so philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
cannot answer what unifies all these
centres. Where and how do the centres get
unified? The centres in the brain are all different,
and there is not one centre which controls
all the others; therefore, so far as it goes,
the <i>Sânkhya</i> psychology stands unchallenged
upon this point. We must have this unification,
something upon which the sensations will
be reflected to form a complete whole. Until
there is that something I cannot have any idea
of you, or the picture, or anything else. If
we had not that unifying something we would
only see, then after a while hear, and then
feel, and while we heard a man talking we
should not see him at all, because all the centres
are different.</p>

<p>This body is made of particles which we
call matter, and it is dull and insentient. So
is what is called the fine body. The fine body,
according to the <i>Sânkhyas</i> is a little body, made
of very fine particles, so fine that no microscope
can see them. What is the use of it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
It is the receptacle of what we call mind. Just
as this gross body is the receptacle of the
grosser forces, so the fine body is the receptacle
of the finer forces, that which we call thought,
in its various modifications. First is the body,
which is gross matter, with gross force. Force
cannot exist without matter. It can only manifest
itself through matter, so the grosser forces
work through the body and those very forces
become finer; the very force which is working
in a gross form works in a fine form and becomes
thought. There is no real difference
between them, simply one is the gross and the
other the fine manifestation of the same thing.
Neither is there any difference in substance
between the fine body and the gross body. The
fine body is also material, only very fine
material.</p>

<p>Whence do all these forces come? According
to the Vedânta philosophy there are two
things in Nature, one of which they call <i>Âkâsa</i>,
which is substance, or matter, infinitely fine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
and the other they call <i>Prâna</i>. Whatever you
see, or feel, or hear, as air or earth, or anything,
is material. And everything is a form
of this <i>âkâsa</i>. It becomes finer and finer, or
grosser and grosser, and it changes under the
action of <i>Prâna</i> (universal Energy). Like
<i>âkâsa</i>, <i>prâna</i> is omnipresent, interpenetrating
everything. <i>Âkâsa</i> is like the water, and
everything else in the universe like blocks of
ice, made out of that water and floating in
it, and <i>prâna</i> is the power that changes the
<i>âkâsa</i> into all these various forms. This body
is the instrument made out of <i>âkâsa</i> for the
manifestation of <i>prâna</i> in gross forms, as muscular
motion, or walking, sitting, talking, and
so on. The fine body also is made of <i>âkâsa</i>,
a much finer form of <i>âkâsa</i>, for the manifestation
of the same <i>prâna</i> in the finer form of
thought. So, first there is this gross body,
beyond that is the fine body, and beyond that
is the <i>jiva</i> (soul), the real man. Just as these
finger nails can be pared off a hundred times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
a year, and yet are still a part of our bodies,
not different, so we have not two bodies. It
is not that man has a fine and also a gross
body; it is the one body, only it remains longer
when it is a fine body, and the grosser it is the
sooner it dissolves. Just as I can cut this
nail a hundred times a year, so millions of
times I can shed this body in one æon, but the
fine body will remain. According to the dualists
this <i>jiva</i>, or the real man, is very fine,
minute.</p>

<p>So far we have seen that man is a being
who has first a gross body which dissolves
very quickly, then a fine body which remains
through æons, and lastly a <i>jiva</i>. This <i>jiva</i>,
according to the Vedânta philosophy, is eternal,
just as God is eternal, and Nature is also eternal,
but changefully eternal. The material of
Nature, the <i>prâna</i> and the <i>âkâsa</i>, are eternal,
but are changing into different forms eternally.
Matter and force are eternal, but their combinations
vary continually. The <i>jiva</i> is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
manufactured, either of <i>âkâsa</i>, or of <i>prâna</i>;
it is immaterial, and therefore will remain
for ever. It is not the result of any combination
of <i>prâna</i> and <i>âkâsa</i>, and whatever is not
the result of combination will never be destroyed,
because destruction is decomposition.
That which is not a compound cannot be
destroyed. The gross body is a compound of
<i>âkâsa</i> and <i>prâna</i> in various forms and will be
decomposed. The fine body will also be decomposed
after a long time, but the <i>jiva</i> is a
simple, and will never be destroyed. For the
same reason, we cannot say it ever was born.
Nothing simple can be born; the same argument
applies. Only that which is a compound
can be born. The whole of this nature combined
in these millions of forms is under the
will of God. God is all pervading, omniscient,
formless, everywhere, and He is directing this
nature day and night. The whole of it is
under His control. There is no independence
of any being. It cannot be. He is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Ruler. This is the teaching of dualistic Vedânta.</p>

<p>Then the question comes, if God be the Ruler
of this universe, why did He create such a
wicked universe, why must we suffer so much?
The answer is made that it is not God’s fault.
It is our own fault that we suffer. Whatever
we sow that we reap. God does not do anything
to punish us. If a man is born poor,
or blind, or lame, he did something before he
was born in that way, something that produced
these results. The <i>jiva</i> has been existing for
all time, was never created. It has been doing
all sorts of things all the time. Whatever we
do we suffer for. If we do good we shall have
happiness, and if bad, unhappiness. This <i>jiva</i>
is by its own nature pure, but ignorance covers
its nature, says the dualist. As by evil deeds it
has covered itself with ignorance, so by good
deeds it can become conscious of its own nature
again. Just as it is eternal, so its nature is
pure. The nature of every being is pure. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
through good deeds all its sins and misdeeds
have been washed away, then the <i>jiva</i> becomes
pure again, and when he becomes pure he goes
after death by what is called <i>Devayana</i> (the
path of the gods), to heaven, or the abode of
the gods. If he has been only an ordinarily
good man he goes to what is called the “Abode
of the Fathers.”</p>

<p>When the gross body falls, the organs of
speech enter the mind. You cannot think
without words; wherever there are words there
must be thought. The mind is resolved into
the <i>prâna</i>, and the <i>prâna</i> resolves into the <i>jiva</i>.
Then the <i>jiva</i> leaves the body and goes to that
condition of reward or punishment which he
has earned by his past life. <i>Devaloka</i> is the
“place (or abode) of the gods.” The word
<i>deva</i> (god) means bright or shining one, and
corresponds to what the Christians and Mohammedans
call “angels.” According to this
teaching there are various heavenly spheres
somewhat analogous to the various heavens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
described by Dante in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
There are the heaven of the fathers (or <i>pitris</i>),
<i>devaloka</i>, the lunar sphere, the electric sphere
and highest of all the <i>Brahmaloka</i>, the heaven
of <i>Brahma</i>. From all the lower heavens the
<i>jiva</i> returns again to human birth, but he who
attains to <i>Brahmaloka</i> lives there through all
eternity. These are the highest men who have
become perfectly unselfish, perfectly purified,
who have given up all desires, do not want to
do anything except to worship and love God.
There is a second class, who do good works,
but want some reward, want to go to heaven
in return. When they die the <i>jiva</i> goes to the
lunar sphere, where it enjoys and becomes a
<i>deva</i> (god or angel). The gods, the <i>devas</i>,
are not eternal, they have to die. In heaven
they will all die. The only deathless place is
<i>Brahmaloka</i>, where alone there is no birth and
no death. In our mythology it is said there are
also the demons, who sometimes give the gods
chase. In all mythologies you read of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
fights between the demons, or wicked angels,
and the gods and sometimes the demons conquer
the gods. In all mythologies also, you
find that the <i>devas</i> were fond of the beautiful
daughters of men. As a <i>deva</i>, the <i>jiva</i> only
reaps results of past actions, but makes no new
Karma. Only man makes Karma. Karma
means actions that will produce effects, also
those effects, or results of action. When a
man dies and becomes a <i>deva</i> he has a period
of pleasure, and during that time makes no
fresh Karma; he simply enjoys the reward of
his past good works. But when the good
Karma is worked out then the other Karma
begins to take effect.</p>

<p>In the Vedas there is no mention of hell.
But afterwards the <i>Purânas</i>, the later books in
our Scriptures, thought that no religion could
become complete without a proper attachment
of hells, and so they invented all sorts of hells,
with as many, if not more, varieties of punishment
than Dante saw in his <i>Inferno</i>, but our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
books are merciful enough to say that it is
only for a period. Bad Karma is worked out
in that state and then the souls come back to
earth and get another chance. This human
form is the great chance. It is called the
<i>karmic</i> body, in which we decide our fate.
We are running in a huge circle, and this is
the point in the circle which determines the
future. So a human body is considered the
greatest body there is; man is greater than
the gods. Even they return to human birth.
So far with dualistic Vedânta.</p>

<p>Next comes a higher conception of Vedânta
philosophy, which says that these ideas are
crude. If you say there is a God who is an
infinite Being, and a soul which is also infinite,
and Nature which is also infinite, you can go
on multiplying infinites indefinitely, but that
is illogical, because each would limit the other
and there would be no real infinite. God is
both the material and the efficient cause of the
universe; He projects this universe out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Himself. Does that mean that God has become
these walls, and this table, that God has
become the animal, the murderer and all the
evils in the world? God is pure, how can He
become all these degenerate things? He has
not. God is unchangeable, all these changes
are in Nature; just as I am a soul and have a
body, this body is not different from me in a
sense, yet I, the real “I,” in fact am not this
body. For instance, I am a child, I become a
young man, an old man, but my soul has not
changed. It remains the same soul. Similarly
the whole universe comprises all Nature, and
an infinite number of souls, or, as it were, the
infinite body of God. He is interpenetrating
the whole of it. He alone is unchangeable,
but Nature changes and soul changes. In
what way does Nature change? In its forms;
it takes fresh forms. But the soul cannot
change that way. The soul contracts and expands
in knowledge. It contracts by evil deeds;
those deeds which contract the natural knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
and purity of the soul are called evil
deeds. Those deeds, again, which bring out
the natural glory of the soul, are called good
deeds. All these souls were pure, but they
have become contracted by their own acts.
Still, through the mercy of God, and by doing
good deeds, they will expand and become pure
again. Every soul has the same chance, and,
in the long run, must become pure and free
itself from Nature. But this universe will not
cease, because it is infinite. This is the second
theory. The first is called dualistic Vedânta;
the second teaches that there is God, soul, and
Nature, that soul and Nature form the body of
God, and that these three form one unit. Believers
in this second theory are called qualified
non-dualists (<i>Visishtadvaitins</i>).</p>

<p>The last and highest theory is pure monism,
or as it is known in India, <i>Advaita</i>. It also
teaches that God must be both the material and
the efficient cause of this universe. As such,
God has become the whole of this universe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
This theory denies that God is the soul, and
the universe is the body, and the body is
changing. In that case what is the use of
calling God the material cause of this universe?
The material cause is the cause become
effect; the effect is nothing but the cause in
another form. Wherever you see effect, it is
the cause reproduced. If the universe is the
effect, and God the cause, this must be the
reproduction of God. If it be claimed that the
universe is the body of God and that that body
becomes contracted and fine and becomes the
cause, and out of that the universe is evolved,
then the <i>advaitist</i> says it is God Himself who
has become this universe. Now comes a very
fine question. If God has become this universe,
then everything is God. Certainly; everything
is God. My body is God, and my mind is
God, and my soul is God. Then why are there
so many <i>jivas</i>? Has God become divided into
millions and millions of <i>jivas</i>? How can that
infinite power and substance, the one Being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
of the universe become divided? It is impossible
to divide infinity. How can the pure
Being become this universe? If He has become
the universe, He is changeful, and if He
is changeful, He is in Nature, and whatever
is in Nature is born and dies. If God is
changeful, He must die some day. Remember
that. Again, how much of God has become
this universe? If you say “X,” the algebraical
unknown quantity, then God is God minus “X”
now, and therefore not the same God as before
this creation, because so much of Him has
become this universe. The answer of the non-dualist
is that this universe has no real existence,
it exists in appearance only. These <i>devas</i>
and gods and angels and being born and dying,
and all this infinite number of souls coming
up and going down, all these things are mere
dreams. All is the one Infinite. The one sun
reflected on various drops of water appears to
be many, millions of globules of water reflect
so many millions of suns and in each globule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
will be a perfect image of the sun, yet there
is only one sun, and so it is with all these <i>jivas</i>,
they are but reflections of the one infinite
Being. A dream cannot be without a reality,
and that reality is the one infinite Existence.
You, as body, mind, or soul, are a dream, but
what you really are is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute. Thus says the <i>Advaitist</i>. All
these births and rebirths, this coming and going
are but parts of the dream. You are infinite.
Where can you go? The sun, moon, and the
whole universe are but a drop in your nature.
How can you be born or die? The Self was
never born, never will be born, never had father
or mother, friends or foes, for it is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss
Absolute.</p>

<p>What is the goal, according to this philosophy?
That those who receive this knowledge
are one with the universe; for them all
heavens, even <i>Brahmaloka</i>, are destroyed, the
whole dream vanishes, and they find themselves
the eternal God of the universe. They attain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
their real individuality, infinitely beyond these
little selves which we now think of so much
importance. No individuality will be lost; an
infinite and eternal Individuality will be realized.
Pleasures in little things will cease. We
are finding pleasure in this little body, in this
little individuality. How much greater the
pleasure when this whole universe is in our
one body? If there be pleasure in these separate
bodies, how much more when all bodies
are one? The man who has realized this has
attained to freedom, has gone beyond the
dream and known himself in his real nature.
This is the teaching of Advaita, the non-dualistic
Vedânta.</p>

<p>These are the three steps which Vedânta
philosophy has taken, and we cannot go beyond,
because we cannot go beyond unity. When
any science reaches a unity it cannot possibly
go any farther. You cannot go beyond this
idea of the Absolute, the One Idea of the universe,
out of which everything else has evolved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
All people cannot take up this <i>Advaita</i> philosophy;
it is too hard. First of all, it is very
difficult to understand it intellectually. It
requires the sharpest of intellects, a bold understanding.
Secondly, it does not suit the vast
majority of people.</p>

<p>It is better to begin with the first of these
three steps. Then by thinking of that and
understanding it, the second one will open of
itself. Just as a race travels, so individuals
have to travel. The steps which the human
race has taken to come to the highest pinnacle
of religious thought, every individual will have
to take. Only, while the human race took
millions of years to reach from one step to
another, individuals may live the whole life
of the human race in a few years, or they may
be able to do it more quickly, perhaps in six
months. But each one of us will have to go
through these steps. Those of you who are
non-dualists can, no doubt, look back to the
period of your lives when you were strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
dualists. As soon as you think you are a body
and a mind, you will have to accept the whole
of this dream. If you have one piece you must
take the whole. The man who says, here is
this world but there is no God, is a fool, because
if there be a world there will have to be
a cause of the world, and that is what is called
God. You cannot have an effect without
knowing that there is a cause. God will only
vanish when this world vanishes. When you
have realized your one-ness with God, this
world will no longer be for you. As long as
this dream exists, however, we are bound to
see ourselves as being born and dying, but as
soon as the dream that we are bodies vanishes,
so will vanish this dream that we are being
born and dying, and so will vanish the other
dream that there is a universe. That very
thing which we now see as this universe will
appear to us as God, and that very God who
was so long external, will appear as the very
Self of our own selves. The last word of
<i>Advaita</i> is, <i>Tat tvam asi</i>,—“That thou art.”</p>

<p>“One of the great thought challengers of the day is this work
by the Swâmi Vivekânanda. The book goes deep and treats of
startling things, but when analyzed and viewed from the author’s
standpoint, they are found to be links in the great chain of truth.
He alone will deny who is out of sympathy or limited in vision.”—<i>Transcript</i>,
Boston, Sept. 24, 1902.</p>

<p>“Students of religion will find much of interest in it; those
who care for India in any way will be glad to receive an indication
of high Hindu thought in one of the most striking religious
movements of the day; while the orthodox Christian will derive
some information from the work regarding the attitude of cultured
Hindus toward Christianity and its Founder. After reading the
book one is inexcusable if his ideas concerning Vedânta are
hazy.”—<i>New York Saturday Review of Books</i>, July 12, 1902.</p>

<p>“The lectures show a wonderful insight into great truths
which underlie all religious aspiration.”—<i>Courier Journal</i>, Louisville,
July 5, 1902.</p>

<p>“The altruism with which his preaching is permeated attracts
and inspires. The love of humanity which he inculcates harmonizes
with the spirit of the age, His English is good, his style easy
to read, his sincerity unquestionable. Merely as an intelligent presentation
of what is best in the ancient Hindu Scriptures, the
Swâmi Vivekânanda’s book is deserving of attention at the hands
of religious students.”—<i>Record-Herald</i>, Chicago, Aug. 19, 1902.</p>

<p>“The lectures are all extremely interesting, the style brilliant,
the reasoning often subtle. Whether the philosophy advanced is
satisfactory or not to those whose theories are the outgrowth of a
different system of thought, his method of presenting it affords an
intellectual pleasure.”—<i>Journal</i>, Indianapolis, Oct. 13, 1902.</p>

<p>“It is a book which appeals to the intellectual, and no one
could be the worse for reading it, since it contains much of truth
even as Christians measure truth.”—<i>Milwaukee Sentinel</i>, Aug, 15,
1902.</p>

<p>“The Vedânta Philosophy as explained by Vivekânanda is
interesting.... As given by him and his followers, no more
lofty teachings can be found. The work is a valuable addition to
the literature of religions.”—<i>Toledo Blade</i> Oct. 11, 1902.</p>

without in any way attacking the method of others. It manifests
a charity that it is usual to call Christian but which Vivekânanda
proves is equally the property of the Hindu. If this little book

<p>Râmakrishna was a great Hindu saint of the nineteenth century
who has already had an influence on the religious thought
of America and England through the teachings of his disciples,
Swâmi Vivekânanda, Swâmi Abhedânanda, and others. His Sayings
are full of broad practical, non-sectarian instructions concerning
the spiritual life which cannot but give help and inspiration
to the followers of all creeds. The present volume contains a
larger number of Sayings than has yet appeared in any one English
collection. For the first time also they have been classified
into chapters and arranged in logical sequence under marginal
headings, such as “All creeds paths to God,” “Power of Mind and
Thought,” “Meditation,” “Perseverance.” As an exposition of
the universal truths of Religion and their application to the
daily life this book takes its place among the great scriptures of
the world.</p>

<p>“This little book gives an account of the character and career
of the remarkable man known in India as Paramahamsa Srimat
Râmakrishna, who is regarded by a great number of his countrymen
as a divine incarnation. It is not more remarkable for the

<p>“The book, besides telling the life of Sri Râmakrishna, gives

forth the more important ideals that vitally influence India’s
teeming millions. If we are willing to sympathetically study the
religious views of our Aryan brethren of the Orient, we shall
find them governed by spiritual concepts in no way inferior to the
highest known to ourselves, concepts which were thought out and
practically applied by these ancient philosophers in ages so remote
as to antedate history.”—<i>Post, Washington</i>, May 13th, 1901.</p>

The Swâmi’s book is therefore not so radical a departure
from accepted thought as might at first be imagined.... It
is not meat for babes, but rather will it give new lines of thought
to the brightest intellects.”—<i>Transcript</i>, Boston, Aug., 1903.</p>

<p>“His method of dealing with these fundamental questions is
peculiarly free both from dogmatic assertion and from pure metaphysical
speculation.”—<i>Inter-Ocean</i>, Chicago, Aug., 1903.</p>

<p>“He bases his arguments, not on theological hypotheses, but on
scientific facts.”—<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i>, Aug., 1903.</p>

<p>“It is written in a plain and logical style, and cannot fail to
interest all who are anxious for information concerning the philosophy
of which the author is such an able exponent.”—<i>Times</i>,
Pittsburg, June, 1903.</p>

<p>“A glance over a few of its pages would be sufficient to convince
the reader that he is in the presence of an intellect of high
order, more thoroughly conversant with the philosophies and
sciences of the Occidental world than most Europeans or
Americans.... The ‘Divine Heritage of Man’ gives a rare
insight into the religious views of educated Hindoos and its
argumentation furnishes an intellectual treat.”—<i>Chronicle</i>, San
Francisco, Aug., 1903.</p>

<p>“Fully cognizant of modern scientific discoveries, the author
treats his subject broadly.”—<i>Bookseller, Newsdealer, and Publisher</i>,
New York, Aug., 1903.</p>

<p>“The student of religions will find much of value in the discourses,
since they are full of historical information concerning
the origin and growth of certain ideas and beliefs dominant in
Christianity.”—<i>Republican</i>, Denver, July, 1903.</p>

<p>“There is no disposition on the part of the author to assail
any of the Christian principles, but he simply presents his subject
with calmness, not attempting to reconcile religion and science,
for to him they are one.”—<i>Washington Post</i>, June, 1903.</p>

<p>“For Christians interested in foreign missions this book is of
moment, as showing the method of reasoning which they must be
prepared to meet if they are to influence the educated Hindu. To
the Orientalist, and the philosopher also, the book is not without
interest.... Swâmi Abhedânanda preaches no mushroom
creed and no Eurasian hybrid ‘theosophy.’ He aims to give us a
compendious account of Yoga. Clearly and admirably he performs
his task. In form the little bank is excellent, and its
English style is good.”—<i>New York Times Saturday Review of
Books</i>, Dec. 6, 1902.</p>

<p>“‘How to be a Yogi’ is a little volume that makes very interesting
reading. The book contains the directions that must be
followed in physical as well as in mental training by one who
wishes to have full and perfect control of all his powers.”—<i>Record-Herald</i>,
Chicago, Feb. 28, 1903.</p>

<p>“The Swâmi writes in a clear, direct manner. His chapter on
Breath will elicit more than ordinary attention, as there is much
in it that will prove helpful. The book makes a valuable addition
to Vedânta Philosophy.”—<i>Mind</i>, June, 1903.</p>

<p>“The book is calculated to interest the student of Oriental
thought and familiarize the unread with one of the greatest philosophical
systems of the world.”—<i>Buffalo Courier</i>, Nov. 23, 1902.</p>

<p>“‘How to be a Yogi’ practically sums up the whole science of
Vedânta Philosophy. The term Yogi is lucidly defined and a full
analysis is given of the science of breathing and its bearing on the
highest spiritual development. The methods and practices of Yoga
are interestingly set forth, and not the least important teaching of
the book is the assertion of how great a Yogi was Jesus of Nazareth.”—<i>The
Bookseller, Newsdealer and Stationer</i>, Jan. 15, 1903.</p>

<p>“This book is well worth a careful reading. Condensed, yet
clear and concise, it fills one with the desire to emulate these
Yogis in attaining spiritual perfection.”—<i>Unity</i>, Kansas City,
Dec., 1902.</p>

<p>“So practically and exhaustively is each phase of the subject
treated that it may well serve as a text-book for any one striving
for self-development and a deeper understanding of human nature.”—<i>Toronto
Saturday Night</i>, Dec., 1905.</p>

<p>“It will also be welcomed by students of the Vedic Scriptures,
since each chapter is based upon some one of the ancient Vedas
known as the Upanishads, and many passages are quoted.”—<i>Chicago
Inter-Ocean</i>, Jan., 1906.</p>

<p>“The book, from the gifted pen of the head of the Vedânta
Society of New York, presents in a clear manner, calculated to arrest
the attention of those not yet familiar with Vedic literature,
the principles of self-knowledge as taught by the leaders of that
philosophy.... The many passages quoted prove the profound
wisdom and practical teaching contained in the early Hindu
Scriptures.”—<i>Washington Evening Star</i>, Dec., 1905.</p>

<p>“A new book which will be welcome to students of Truth,
whether it be found in the Eastern religions, in modern thought
or elsewhere.”—<i>Unity</i>, Nov., 1905.</p>

<p>“The book is very well written.”—<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>,
Dec., 1905.</p>

<p>“In forcefulness and clearness of style it is in every way equal
to the other works by the Swâmi Abhedânanda, who has always
shown himself in his writings a remarkable master of the English
language.”—<i>Mexican Herald</i>, Dec., 1905.</p>

<p>“The volume is forcefully written, as are all of this author’s
works, and cannot fail to be of great interest to all who have entered
this field of thought. A fine portrait of the Swâmi forms
the frontispiece.”—<i>Toledo Blade</i>, Nov., 1905.</p>

<p>“This attractive little volume comprises three lectures on the
Vedânta Philosophy. The discourses will be found vitally helpful
even by those who know little and care less about the spiritual
and ethical teachings of which the Swâmi is an able and popular
exponent. As the Vedânta itself is largely a doctrine of universals
and ultimates, so also is this book of common utility and
significance among all races of believers. Its precepts are susceptible
of application by any rational thinker, regardless of religious
predilection and inherited prejudices. The principles set forth by
this teacher are an excellent corrective of spiritual bias or narrowness,
and as such the present work is to be commended. It has
already awakened an interest in Oriental literature that augurs
well for the cause of human brotherhood, and it merits a wide
circulation among all who cherish advanced ideals.”—<i>Mind</i>,
April, 1902.</p>

<p>“This book has more than usual interest as coming from one
who knows the Occident and both knows and loves the Orient....
It is decidedly interesting.... The book has two
admirable qualities: breadth in scope and suggestiveness in material.”—<i>Bulletin
of the American Geographical Society</i>, Sept.,
1906.</p>

<p>“This volume, written in an attractive style and dealing with
the life, philosophy and religion of India, should prove a useful
addition to the literature of a fascinating and as yet largely unknown
subject. It is designed for popular reading, the metaphysical
portions being so handled that the reader runs little risk
of getting beyond his depth.”—<i>Literary Digest</i>, Feb. 16, 1907.</p>

<p>“The Swâmi possesses the exceptional advantage of being able
to look upon his own country almost from the standpoint of an
outsider and to handle his subject free from both foreign and
native prejudice.”—<i>New York World</i>, Aug. 4, 1906.</p>

<p>“It is a valuable contribution to Western knowledge of India,
containing precisely what the American wants to know about that
region.”—<i>Washington Evening Star</i>, Aug. 4, 1906.</p>
